            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE to the READER.</head>
            <p>A French man not long ſince, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the counterfeit Name of <hi>Lewis Montalt,</hi> printed Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Libells, which he called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Letters.</hi> His main drift was to eſtabliſh the Hereſie of <hi>Janſenius;</hi> that is, that Hereſie, which denieth Chriſt to be the Redeemer of all men; and among other Enormities teacheth, that God commandeth things that are impoſſible, not onely to Sinners, but even to the Juſt. This, I ſay, was his main drift; for this was the occaſion of his writing; with this his firſt Letters begin, in this he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iefly labours, and with this his laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters end. Yet to cloak this foul deſign with a pleaſing out-ſide, he often makes Profeſſion of ſincere Faith, and of great Reverence to the Sea Apoſtolique; and condemneth verbally the Five Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Janſenius</hi> cenſured by the Church as Hereticall. Yet this he doth ſo as ſtill to excuſe <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Doctrine and the
<pb facs="tcp:96350:4"/>
Janſeniſts from Hereſie. He would be thought to drive at nothing, but (the old pretence of Innovatours) a <hi>Reform,</hi> in correcting abuſes and errours crept into Divinity-Schools, eſpecially among the Jeſuites, and by their means into the Church of Chriſt. All this he doth with Raillery and Merriment.</p>
            <p>The unwary vulgar, glad to make merry at any mans coſt, ſported with his Letters; not marking, that whileſt they were invited to make a jeaſt of Charity, it was that they might loſe their Faith in earneſt. But the Learned, and all thoſe, who with a ſober judgement could pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things right, were ſtruck with a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at theſe ſcandalous Libells; and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſad events, which theſe prophane <hi>Railleries</hi> did bode, thought themſelves obliged in conſcience to ſuppreſſe them. For this reaſon theſe Letters were forbid to be printed in <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi> commanded the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen firſt Letters (for the Eighteenth was not then come out) to be publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burnt by the Hang-man, the 9. of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, in the year 1657. On the 13. of <hi>July</hi> in the ſame year, the Archbiſhop
<pb facs="tcp:96350:4"/>
of <hi>Machelen,</hi> Primate of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,</hi> (to ſecure his Subjects) gave his Approbation to the Anſwers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Letters: and a Moneth after, to wit, on the 13. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Vicar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of <hi>Liege</hi> did as much. And on the 6. of <hi>September</hi> then next enſuing, the univerſall Paſtour of the Church, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh now ſitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> condemned all the Eighteen Provinciall Letters, under the Penalties ſpecified in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Index of <hi>Forbidden Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe infamous Letters then, branded with the ignominy of ſo many Cenſures, and baniſht all Catholique Countreys, came for their refuge into <hi>England.</hi> And they found a Tranſlatour, who either for his hatred to the Catholique Church, or private ſpleen to the Jeſuites, or for love of Janſeniſme, or for deſire of gain, (for nothing ſells better then a Libell) ſet them out in an Engliſh dreſſe: And that they might the better pleaſe thoſe ears, which itch to hear ſomething againſt the Jeſuites, he baptized them by a new name of <hi>the Myſtery of Jeſuitiſme;</hi> it being common to Fugitives that are forced
<pb facs="tcp:96350:5"/>
to flye their Countrey, to change their name.</p>
            <p>And the good Tranſlatour preſumed ſo much of his own Work, that in the Preface to his firſt Edition he could not hold from propheſying in his own praiſes, and telling us, what a ſtrange Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis there would follow in the world upon reading theſe Letters done by him into Engliſh. For ſpeaking of his Book he ſaith, <hi>It muſt needs work a ſtrange al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in mankinde.</hi> What <hi>Alteration?</hi> This. The Jeſuites hitherto by all men held in eſteem for Learning and Vertue, (if we believe this Tranſlatours Poeticall Propheſie) <hi>will be looked on hereafter as the moſt abominable and deſpicable thing in the world.</hi> Surely this man taketh the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites for an Army of Philiſtims, which he is to conquer with the Jaw-bone of an Aſſe. But Good Mr. Tranſlatour, do you indeed think as you ſay? The world hath thought the Jeſuites men of ſome worth. The Wiſeſt of our Age have given them commendation; they have had learned Adverſaries, both Proteſtants and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, who oppoſed them ſo as not to deſpiſe them. Their Induſtry hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
<pb facs="tcp:96350:5"/>
through all Sciences, as well as their Charity through all Nations. Their Books are honoured in all Libraries; and their Perſons reverenced in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, Cities, and Towns, where Catholick Religion is in eſteem. Muſt all the world now change their judgement? and muſt they that have hitherto had a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, <hi>be looked on hereafter as the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and deſpicable thing in the world?</hi> But Why? How? by What Means muſt this <hi>ſtrange Alteration</hi> be wrought in Mankinde? let's hear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quid dignum tanto ſcret hic promiſſor hiatu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe a French man, whoſe Letters this Tranſlatour hath done into Engliſh, ſaith ſo. But who was that French man? A man that by his own confeſſion is no Church-man, no Prieſt, no Doctour, no Proteſtant, no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. A man, of whom all the good that's known, is that he can write a Libell well, and challenge others boldly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever heeding whether what he ſaith be true or falſe, Catholique or Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, ſenſe or non-ſenſe. A man, that's aſhamed of nothing but of himſelf; for in all his daring Propoſitions he dareth
<pb facs="tcp:96350:6"/>
not ſay who he is; in all his deſperate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures he will not venture to ſhew his face.</p>
            <p>And ſhall ſuch a man as this <hi>work that ſtrange Alteration in Mankinde?</hi> Shall a Libell be able to ſway the judgement of the Wiſe, and ballance all that the Light of Reaſon can dictate to the contrary? The Catholique Church is full of men of all ranks and conditions, Rich and Poor, Noble and Ignoble, Religious and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Souldiers and Gown-men, who from their childhood to the ſeverall ages they are now in, have been familiarly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Society, and had the firſt Tinctures of Learning and Vertue under them; muſt they now all change their judgements, and <hi>hereafter</hi> count the Society <hi>the moſt deſpicable and moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing in the world,</hi> becauſe a French Libell turn'd into Engliſh ſpeaketh them to be quite contrary, to what the world knoweth them, and ſeeth them to be? <hi>Ad populum phaleras.</hi> The world, as old as it is, is not yet come to ſo doting an age, as to think they muſt rather believe an infamous Libell, then their own eyes, their own reaſon, their own long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb facs="tcp:96350:6"/>
The effect ſheweth what ſpirit animated the Tranſlatour in this Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſme. 'Tis two years ſince the Book hath been out, and the world hath ſeen no alteration wrought by this Work: the Jeſuites have not loſt one Friend by means of it. Had this Letter-writer endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep within compaſſe, and to ſhew us that the Jeſuites are not all ſuch Saints, but that there are ſome faults in their lives, and that their Doctrine is not all ſo Sacred, but that ſome opinions of theirs may be impugned, and ſome reprehended, he might have been believed: and the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites themſelves, though they would have reſented it, that their faults ſhould be blazed about the world without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, yet they would have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that they are not impeccable nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Doctrine nor Manners. 'Tis a priviledge reſerved for Heaven, that no faults can there be found: here on earth that Community is happieſt, which hath feweſt faults: none are without all fault. But to taxe the Jeſuites Doctrine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as a <hi>monſtrous Source of all Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,</hi> and their Perſons as <hi>the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and deſpicable thing in the world,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96350:7"/>
that is a meer Paradox, which begets a disbelief, giveth it ſelf the lye, and by ſaying too much ſaith nothing. Over-reaching praiſes are laughed at, and too exceſſive reprehenſions are ſcorned by all wiſe men.</p>
            <p>The Jeſuites have many that reprehend them, and ſo have all thoſe that are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and ſeem to overtop others in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be. For Glory and Envy are Twins; one is never borne without t'other. Honour ſhould be, but in our Age Detraction is, the ſhadow of Vertue, which darkens its Luſtre: Calumny al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lodgeth over againſt Piety, to ſpy her Actions and defame her Glory. It was a Fable, that there was a <hi>Momus</hi> among the Gods in Heaven; but it is not a Fable, that the <hi>Heroes</hi> of this world are never without a <hi>Momus,</hi> to cenſure what ſoever they do. But as the Greek Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is eaſie to play the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, eaſie to reprehend, but hard to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; ſo I ſay to theſe Cenſorian ſpirits, Let them mend what they reprehend. Let them do ſomething like that, which the Jeſuits do; and ſee, whether they can
<pb facs="tcp:96350:7"/>
do it, and not fall into more faults, then the Jeſuites do. Let them employ as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred Maſters in teaching Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Poetry, Rhetorique, Arithmetique, Mathematiques, Philoſophy, Divinity Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and Speculative. Let them trace the Jeſuites ſcattered over the face of the whole earth, in all the Nations on which the Sun doth ſhine, for to convert Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells. Let them Catechize, Preach, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Sacraments, viſit the Sick, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Hoſpitals and Priſons, comfort the Poor, direct Souls in all ſtates: let them write as many learned Books, as the Jeſuits do; and then let's ſee, whether they can do all this without deſerving a Cenſure oftner then the Jeſuits do. They that reprehend others, ought to be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves irreprehenſible; at leaſt in that which they cenſure. And yet this is the Janſeniſts misfortune, that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Jeſuits Books; and ſcarce have yet ſet out one (of the many which they have printed) that is not cenſured.</p>
            <p>But there is difference betwixt cenſure and cenſure. The Janſeniſts cenſure the Jeſuits Books, and the Catholique Church cenſures the Janſeniſts Books. The Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts
<pb facs="tcp:96350:8"/>
cenſure the Jeſuites <hi>Morall,</hi> and the Church cenſureth the Janſeniſts <hi>Faith.</hi> The Janſeniſts ſet out Libells againſt the Jeſuites, and the Church thundereth Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's, in the Popes Bulls, againſt the Janſeniſts. So different are the Cenſures. Yet this is not all. The grand Difference betwixt the Cenſures is, that the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which the Church layes on the Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts, fall on their reall Crimes: but the Cenſures, which the Janſeniſts give the Jeſuits Doctrine, is grounded on falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and meer Calumny. This is clearly ſhewed in the Book, which here is anſwered. All the whole Book of the <hi>Provinciall Letters,</hi> which caſts ſo much durt on the Jeſuits, that the Tranſlatour calls it <hi>The Myſtery of Jeſuitiſme,</hi> is a falſe and groundleſſe Cenſure, given by an Heretique to Doctrine, which hath the generall Approbation of Schools. When I ſay an <hi>Heretique,</hi> I would not have our Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> think themſelves concern'd. I underſtand the <hi>Janſenian</hi> Heretique, who diſſents as far from the Proteſtant, as he doth from the Catholique. This then is the aim of theſe Anſwers, to ſhew that the Cenſures,
<pb facs="tcp:96350:8"/>
which the Provinciall Letters lay on the Jeſuites Doctrine, are groundleſſe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and falſe Calumnies, and meer Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures: and ſo the Tranſlatour hath his <hi>Myſtery</hi> revealed. It is but a Pacquet of lying Letters, which he calleth the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Jeſuitiſme;</hi> he might better have called it the <hi>Miſery of Janſeniſme.</hi> For it is the greateſt miſery of the world to be reduced to ſuch ſtreits, as that one cannot ſay any thing, either for himſelf or againſt his Adverſary, which is not falſe. Now this is the Janſeniſts caſe.</p>
            <p>This being ſo (as the Reader will finde it ſo) it appeareth how unreaſonably the Tranſlatour vomits up ſo much gall in the end of his Preface, in making a diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Character of the Jeſuites; where he concludeth that the Jeſuites are to be looked upon as <hi>the Vermin of all Humane Society.</hi> I do not deſire to uſe foul lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; yet if I may uſe this term of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> to any Chriſtian, I conceive it cannot agree with any man ſo well, as with the Authour of the Provinciall Letters. For who is the <hi>Vermin of Mankinde</hi> in matter of Faith, but he that denieth, that Chriſt is the Redeemer of all men; and ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

This <hi>Montalt</hi> doth. Who in civill community can be termed <hi>Vermin,</hi> but the Detractour?

This <hi>Montalt</hi> is convinced to be. Now if the Authour of the Provinciall Letters deſerveth theſe Titles, his Tranſlatour may judge, what part of theſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations reflects on him. I will not deal him any part; all I ſay as to him is, that I am ſorry to ſee him miſlead, and I wiſh him hereafter a better employment to practiſe his pen on, then the tranſlating of condemned Libells.</p>

Now as to the Reader, to give him ſome ſhort account of this Work, it containeth ſeverall Pieces made by the Jeſuites in <hi>France</hi> in Anſwer to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Letters; which though our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Preface-maker deſpiſes, yet they do unanſwerably convince the Letter-writer of being an arrant cheat, and of falſifying Authours. I will not ſay much of the Particulars, becauſe I have put to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Pieces, Prefaces and Arguments, which may direct the Reader. Some Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are added in this Edition, as the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Janſeniſme, the Anſwer to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply made in Defence of the Twelfth Letter, the Anſwer to the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Letter, and another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, in the Second Engliſh Edition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Seventeenth and Eighteenth: Alſo the Concluſion of the Work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Additionalls. Theſe Pieces either not being at all made in <hi>France,</hi> or not come to my hands, I have ſupplied. The reſt is taken out of the French An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer made by ſome of the Society, with little alterations; which are noted in the places, where any conſiderable change is made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96350:10"/>
If theſe Anſwers ſeem to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too much of the <hi>Picquant,</hi> the Reader will reflect, that 'tis neceſſity, which putteth the Author on that ſtrain. The light of nature teacheth, that he that wrongfully impeacheth an innocent perſon, giveth him right to challenge his Accuſer of unjuſt dealing. 'Tis no inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility to call that man an Impoſtour, a Cheat, a Liar, who by groſſe calumnies, and notorious falſities is proved to wrong another man. The Authour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Letters begun firſt, and treated the Jeſuites as Sycophants, as Corrupters of the Doctrine of the Church, as Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of all ſorts of Crimes. The Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites argue him of falſly calumniating them and their Authours, of Forging and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, of wrongfully taxing good and ſolid Doctrine, whileſt in the mean time he venteth Hereſies. If this ſeems hard, he muſt thank himſelf; 'tis but a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting on him thoſe terms, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly caſt on the Society, and on all School-Divines. This I thought fit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe the Reader of.</p>
            <p>All the favour I deſire is, that the Learned Reader will ſhew no favour to
<pb facs="tcp:96350:10"/>
either ſide, but as an equall Judge hear both Parties; and (if he have leiſure to view the Authours) I entreat him to do Truth ſo much right, as to ſay what he findes. For example, the Doctrine of Probability is by the Authour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Letters, called an Invention of the Jeſuites to palliate crimes, and give ſcope to Libertines. The Jeſuites an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the Doctrine of Probability is no Invention of theirs; they cite for that Doctrine a great number of learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, none of them Jeſuites, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them dead, long before the Jeſuites were in the world. That which here I deſire the Learned Reader to do is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Authours which the Jeſuites produce for this Doctrine, and as they finde them cited, ſo to pronounce who is the cheat and who hath wronged t'other.</p>
            <p>This I deſire of the learned. For the unlearned, or thoſe that will not take the pains to look into Books of Divinity, I expect ſo much reaſon at their hands, that they will not prejudicate; but rather cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the Anſwers here given them by men of known worth (who cite their Authors, and give their reaſons) then an idle Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter,
<pb facs="tcp:96350:11"/>
who bringeth neither reaſon nor authority for himſelf; but with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous boldneſſe, profeſſing himſelf to have no skill in Divinity, undertakes to cenſure all Divines.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe Readers, who are bred to ſuch <hi>Idaea's</hi> of Catholique Religion, that they confound <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Pope and Antichriſt, Saints and Idolls, Sacraments and Sacriledges, to whom a Jeſuit and a Monſter are two words that ſignifie the ſame thing; for thoſe, I ſay, I commend them to the Man in the Moon to cure their Phrenſie. When they have either more wit, or leſſe paſſion, they will accuſe thoſe who lead them into illuſion, and abuſe their ignorance to make non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe of their Faith. This Book hopes no favour, nor fears no cenſure from ſuch. 'Tis not meant for thoſe, that either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or will not judge right. 'Tis preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the impartiall Readers, either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants or Catholique; who when they have read it, will (I hope) finde ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for 'tis a ſatisfaction to upright mindes to ſee Impudence put to a juſt confuſion, and Innocency defended.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF JANSENISME.</head>
            <p>BEcauſe it will be neceſſary for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Work, to have ſome generall Notion of the Tranſactions in matter of <hi>Janſeniſme,</hi> I have taken ſome pains to gather together thoſe things, which I hope will ſatisfie the Reader. And for to make the Relation Authenticall, I have not taken any thing on report onely, or out of thoſe Authours who have made Invectives againſt the Janſeniſts; but out of the Publique Acts known to the whole world, or out of the Janſeniſts own Writings. If the things that I ſet down be ſcandalous Enormities, I hope the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will judge, that the blame ought not to reflect on Catholique Religion. In the Primitive Church there were dives Heretiques, Ebionites, Marcionites, Nicolaites, and others, whoſe Maximes lead men to moſt foul Crimes: yet the Primitive Church had not then the leſſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and ſanctity, nor now the leſſe eſteem, for their impieties. As that age, ſo this and all others are to be judged of, by the piety of the faithfull, not by the impiety of thoſe, whom pride hath made Rebells againſt Chriſt and his Church.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96350:12"/>
Had the Janſeniſts been members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, they would never have taught Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine againſt the Church. But by teaching and profeſſing this Doctrine, <hi>exierunt ex nobis,</hi> they are <hi>gone out,</hi> and the Catholique Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more reſponſable for their lives or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, then for <hi>Arius, Neſtorius,</hi> or any other Heretique. This I thought fit to advertiſe the Reader of, that he be not ſcandalized, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Church by thoſe, who are not of the Church, but are her declared Enemies.</p>
            <p>This premiſed, I come to the Hiſtory it ſelf. There are then three Perſons, who may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, as the main Authours and Abbettours of the Hereſies, which are now commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the name of <hi>Janſeniſme;</hi> of whom the three following Paragraphs ſhall treat.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>§ 1. <hi>Of the Abbot of St.</hi> Gygiran, <hi>commonly called</hi> San-Cyran.</head>
               <p>In the Year of our Lord 1638. on the Fifth Day of <hi>June, Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, King of <hi>France,</hi> granted a Warrant for the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>John du Vergier de Haurannes,</hi> Native of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> commonly known by the Title of <hi>Abbot of St. Cyran,</hi> and <hi>Claudius Seguenot</hi> an Oratorian Prieſt. This was done by the King, upon Information given to his Majeſty of the ſcandalous and falſe Doctrine, which theſe two perſons did ſow, as well in <hi>Paris,</hi> as other places of <hi>France,</hi> to the perverſion of the Catholique Faith, and ſubverſion alſo (as <hi>Monſieur Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rande</hi>

San-Cyran</hi> therefore being apprehended, (for of <hi>Seguenot,</hi> I intend not to ſpeak) was carried Priſoner to <hi>Bois de Vincennes</hi> near <hi>Paris,</hi> all his Papers being ſeized on, and ſtrict Information taken of thoſe who were known to be conſcious of his Doctrine; and particularly of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which lived to the number of about Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty together in the Houſe of <hi>Port-Royall,</hi> ſome ſix or ſeven leagues off <hi>Paris.</hi> This <hi>Port-Royall</hi> is a Monaſtery of Nuns, committed to St. <hi>Cyrans</hi> direction by the Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi> deceived, as he ſince profeſſed, by the opinion he had of <hi>San-Cyrans</hi> Sanctity: But the Diſciples I ſpeak of were men, who in a Quarter joyning to the Nuns Monaſtery, were brought up, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principles of that Doctrine, which now beareth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame of Janſeniſme. There is alſo another Houſe called <hi>Port-Royall,</hi> in the Suburbs of St. <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is meant by <hi>Port-Royall</hi> in this Treatiſe; the Nuns whereof, and their Directours, hold the ſame ſtrain of Doctrine with the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>San-Cyran</hi> then being Priſoner in the <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> and the Informations fully made by the Commiſſaries and Judges deputed by the King and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> he was found evidently criminall in divers points, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Catholique Faith, and the Doctrine of Chriſtian Duty. The Judges inclining to mildneſſe, would not proceed to rigour againſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96350:13"/>
him, but by the Kings advice a Paper was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, containing the Catholique Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contrary to his Maximes; which if he would have ſigned and promiſed to obſerve, he had been ſet free. But the Abbot, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had the impudence to deny all that, of which by evident witneſſe of irreproachable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and by his own Letters, as likewiſe of his Friends to him, he was convinced, yet he would not be brought to ſign the Catholique Articles; but choſe rather to remain Priſoner, then by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Catholique Faith, to unſay in publick what he had privately taught. Some time after, the King, who now drew towards an end of his days, reſolved to cloſe up his life by a Royall act of Clemency; which was the freeing of priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and recalling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xiles from their baniſhment. He had very great difficulty to reſolve on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>San-Cyran;</hi> but being ſollicited by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Abbots Friends, who undertook for him, that he ſhould never meddle with writing, or ſpreading his venomous Doctrine, at length his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſty condeſcended, that this Abbot alſo, among others, ſhould be ſet at liberty. But the King was no ſooner dead, but that <hi>San-Cyran</hi> fell to his old trade of venting his pernicious Maximes, and laid down the draught of the Book now called <hi>Frequent Communion;</hi> which though he never lived to ſee finiſhed, yet it came out afterward under the name of <hi>Arnauld,</hi> a Doctour of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> of whom we ſhall ſpeak in the third Paragraph.</p>
               <p>All this relation I have out of the Book called <hi>the Progreſſe of Janſeniſme,</hi> dedicated to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96350:13"/>
Chauncellour of <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Monſieur Preville,</hi> and printed in the year 1655. In which Book is contained the whole Information made againſt <hi>San-Cyran,</hi> by perſons of worth, who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and who having anſwered upon oath to the Interrogotories made by the Juſtice, did at length every one of them ſign what they had depoſed. Now out of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique Information, (the Originall whereof is in <hi>Clermont</hi> Colledge, and may be ſeen by any man that will) I have taken that which I thought ſufficient, to ſet down what kinde of Doctrine this man vented. I conceive all is not yet known. For <hi>San-Cyran</hi> above all his other Maximes perpetually inculcated to his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, <hi>That they ſhould be ſure to keep ſecret what he taught them; That if they ſpake of any thing, he would deny it; and that if ever they were examined about it, they ſhould deny all, even upon oath.</hi> His conſcience dictated ſo clearly to him the malice of his Maximes, that he was ever moſt unwilling to deliver his Doctrine by writing; and when he could not avoid wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he endeavoured to be obſcure, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe that received his papers, to burn them as ſoon as they had read them. Yet his Friends were not ſo faithfull to him, nor he to himſelfe, but that many of his Writings and Letters either to him or from him, were kept, and ſince diſcovered: all which make a great part of two Books <hi>in Quarto;</hi> and out of them, as concerning <hi>San-Cyrans</hi> Doctrine take what followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt then for himſelf he teacheth, That he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96350:14"/>
hath his Miſſion from God; That God giveth him particular Lights, to know the Interiour of men; That he learneth not his Maximes in Books, but in God; and that his conduct is in all things according to the interiour inſtincts, which God giveth him.</p>
               <p>Secondly for the Church and its Members, he maintaineth, that the Church is not now the ſame which Chriſt planted; That for theſe ſix hundred years laſt paſt the Church is quite cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in Manners, and not onely in Manners, but alſo in Doctrine; That God himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the Church; That the Biſhops and Paſtours of the Church that now are, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the Spirit of Chriſtianity, of the Spirit of Grace, and of the Spirit of the Church: That the Religious Orders, and other Spirituall men of theſe times, underſtand not the Goſpell, nor the wayes of Chriſt; and that he onely hath the true light of the Goſpell, and perfect Intelligence of the Scriptures; That the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> was made by the Pope, and by School-men who have much changed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church; That School-Divinity is a pernicious Science, which ought to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; That St. <hi>Thomas</hi> hath corrupted Divinity by Humane Reaſon; That the Jeſuites ought to be deſtroyed, as moſt domageable to the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for what belongeth to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, he denieth, That all juſt men have ſufficient Grace to keep them. Further he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, That every juſt perſon ought to ſteer his actions according to the interiour motions,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96350:14"/>
which God giveth him, though contrary to the exteriour Law; and this he maintaineth even in Murther; for the committing whereof this interior inſtinct is warrant enough. And according to this Doctrine he maintaineth in his Book called the <hi>Royall Queſtion,</hi> That men may lawfully kill themſelves, and that many times they are bound to kill themſelves. The Reader will note, that this laſt <hi>Tenent</hi> of killing ones ſelf is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in <hi>the Progreſſe of Janſeniſme,</hi> as the reſt are; but he defends it in his Book of the <hi>Royall Queſtion,</hi> as I ſaid. But I have here ſet it down for the ſimilitude it hath with the precedent point.</p>
               <p>Fourthly concerning the Sacraments he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That Confirmation and the Sacrament of Orders, and Epiſcopall Conſecration, that is the making of a Biſhop, blots out all ſins, <hi>quoad culpam &amp; poenam,</hi> like Baptiſme: That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confirmation is more perfect then Baptiſme, hath more force and more efficacy, and requireth no other diſpoſitions: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a man in Mortall Sin hath no need of Confeſſion for to receive the Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. That Veniall Sins are not matter ſufficient for Abſolution: That perfect Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is abſolutely neceſſary for the Sacrament of Penance: That Abſolution is to be deferred a long time, till the Penance be firſt fulfilled: That by Abſolution the Prieſt doth not forgive ſins, but declare them forgiven by ſorrow and penance: That it is not neceſſary to confeſſe the number or <hi>Species</hi> of Mortall ſins, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition be ſufficient. That the Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96350:15"/>
hath more force to forgive ſins, then the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Penance; That the frequenting the Sacraments of Confeſſion and Communion is oftentimes more hurtfull, then profitable; That the calling on the Name of Jeſus is as efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the receiving of the Holy Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and many other like theſe, are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes of <hi>San-Cyran;</hi> which are Authentically ſet down in the Information taken of him, and to be ſeen in <hi>the Progreſſe of Janſeniſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which gave this unfortunate man credit, and made all that he ſaid to be eſteemed good and holy, was his Exteriour appearance, which ſeemed to breath nothing but Sanctity. He was a perſon of a ſad look, ſtern countenance, auſtere carriage, and diſpoſition Hypochondria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all, which the ignorant people interpreted to be the rigour of Penance; attributing that to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Sanctity, which in him was nothing but either Nature or Hypocriſie. The eſteem which the world held in him, bred in him ſuch a height of pride, as made him contemne all that was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. His uſuall ſaying was, That <hi>the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way was for ordinary people.</hi> For himſelf he dream't of nothing, and talk't of nothing, but the Ancient times, the Fathers, the Primitive fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Church, to which he would reduce the World; whoſe univerſall Darkneſſe and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours he did often bemoan, preſuming himſelf to be the onely man able to redreſſe all that was amiſſe.</p>
               <p>He was ſo bold as to aſſever to the Abbot of <hi>Prieres,</hi> that if he would give him Fifteen or Twenty young men, who had never received im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96350:15"/>
from other Maſters, if they would follow his Inſtructions, in the ſpace of ſix moneths, he would make them compleat Divines: And of his Book, called <hi>Petrus Aurelius,</hi> he was ſo vainly conceited, that he ſaid, It was the beſt Book that had been made in the Church theſe ſix hundred Years paſt, though it be a condemned Book; in which, among other groſſe abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he reaches, <hi>That a Prieſt loſeth his Prieſt-hood by committing a mortall Sin:</hi> which is one of <hi>Wiclif</hi>'s Hereſies, and as great a foolery, as if one would teach, that a Chriſtian is unchriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a mortall ſin. Thus his Auſterity, which was partly naturall, partly affected, got him the opinion of Sanctity; and that bred in him a pride and arrogance fit for an Arch Heretique. All this, and much more concerning this Abbot of St. <hi>Cyran,</hi> is to be ſeen in the Information above-mention'd.</p>

conferred with him: he both helped <hi>San-Cyran</hi> in furniſhing him with matter for his <hi>Aurelius;</hi> and was alſo helped himſelf by him in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and publique Speeches, which <hi>San-Cyran,</hi> as being the abler Preacher, ſent him out of <hi>France</hi> upon every occaſion. All this appears by his Letters to this Abbot, which make up a main part of the Book called, <hi>The Birth of Janſeniſme,</hi> and were found in the Abbots chamber, when he was ſeized on.</p>
               <p>Out of the ſame Letters it alſo appears, that <hi>Janſenius</hi> had ſuck'd in all the poiſon of that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique: for he alſo de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But above all he hates the Jeſuits: againſt whom he laboured almoſt perpetually, writing Libells againſt the Society, (that it is not to be wondred, if his Diſciples follow the ſame train) carping at their Doctrine, defending ſuch as apoſtatized from their Order, incenſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperating all men againſt them, that poſſibly he could, and laſtly not forbearing even to cenſure the Pope himſelf for having canonized St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and St. <hi>Xaverius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore it appears by the ſame Letters, that he had no ſmall inclination to favour Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. For of <hi>Marcus Antonius de Dominis,</hi> one whom all the world knows of an Arch-biſhop of <hi>Spalato</hi> to have become an Apoſtata, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enemy of the Church, firſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>England,</hi> he writeth, that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was in a manner Catholique, ſave onely where he touched on the oeconomy of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96350:16"/>
and ſhews, how much he was afraid, leſt the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Lovain</hi> ſhould have required him to write againſt the ſaid Archbiſhop. Beſides, he ſpeaketh very favourably of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> where, although rigid Calviniſme was eſtabliſhed, yet he feareth not to pronounce of the Doctrine of that Synod, that <hi>it was almoſt all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which is moſt of all remarkable, and likewiſe moſt apparently diſcovered in theſe Letters, is the <hi>Grand Deſign</hi> concerted betwixt <hi>Janſenius</hi> and <hi>San-Cyran</hi> in oppoſition to the Jeſuites, to the School-Divines, and to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church. This deſign was the reproving of thoſe Catholique <hi>Tenents,</hi> which were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Society, and in effect by the whole Church, concerning <hi>Grace, Free-will, Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> To compaſſe this deſign, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that from the year, wherein he proceeded Doctour even to his dying day, this man made it his ſtudy to read St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and interpret the many hard places of this great Saint in ſuch manner, as to make St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> teach his own private Hereſies.</p>
               <p>He knew well enough, that his Work would never pleaſe the Pope, as he oftentimes hinteth in his Letters; wherefore his chief labour was firſt to keep it ſecret, fearing, that if it were diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it might be choaked in the womb, and never come to ſee light. And ſecondly to diſpoſe mens mindes ſo by himſelf and by his Friend <hi>San-Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> means, that it might finde ſome great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Authority or Intereſt, who ſhould favour and maintain it. And in effect they got what
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96350:17"/>
they aimed at. For their ſecret was not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and whereas <hi>Janſonius</hi> died before his Work was printed, being taken away by the Plague in the ſecond year of his Biſhoprique at <hi>Ipres,</hi> on the 7. of <hi>May</hi> 1638. his Book not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding found many Patrons both in <hi>Flaunders</hi> and in <hi>France.</hi> In <hi>Flaunders</hi> many of the Univerſity of <hi>Lovain,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Machelen,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and divers others, ſtood ſtifly for defence of this new <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtinus</hi> (for ſo he called his book.) In <hi>France</hi> ſome Biſhops alſo, many <hi>Gurez,</hi> a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the Sorbon, with divers of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Prieſts of Cardinalll <hi>Berull</hi>'s Inſtitution, did the ſame. The reaſons why theſe Perſons engaged ſo far againſt the Truth, I will not here dive into. I believe many were deceived by the very Title of the Work. For he calling his Book <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> they imagined, that a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of <hi>Lovain,</hi> and Biſhop of the Catholique Church, would not give any thing for St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtius</hi> Doctrine, but what was truly his But it is alſo known, that not a few of theſe Defenders of <hi>Janſenius</hi> had a tooth againſt the Order of the Jeſuites; ſo as it was more then probable, that many of them upon that account were eaſily drawn in, and made to embrace the defence of the Book, which they eſteemed to have given ſo fatall a Blow to the Jeſuits Doctrine, that one of the Sorboniſts called it <hi>the Jeſuites Tomb.</hi> As for the Oratorians, their ſpeciall Obligations to <hi>San-Cyran</hi> and <hi>Janſonius</hi> drew them in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they well knew what was intended. For it was a plot of <hi>Janſenius</hi> and <hi>San-Cyran,</hi> which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96350:17"/>
they had practiſed of a long time, to raiſe up theſe Oratorians in oppoſition to the Jeſuites, in hopes (as <hi>Janſenius</hi> expreſſes in his Letters) that they might in a ſhort time get all the Jeſuites Scholars to them; and being but Clergy-men at the Biſhops Diſpoſall, they imagined they ſhould carry the univerſall good-will of the Clergy, ſo that the Jeſuites ſhould at laſt be quite deſerted. This made thoſe poor Oratorians drink ſo deep of the Doctrine of <hi>San-Cyran</hi> and <hi>Janſenius,</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Books were condemned, as namely <hi>Gibieufs</hi> and <hi>Seguenots;</hi> which I do not ſay to cenſure them univerſally, or the <hi>major</hi> part of them: but it is certain, that they were looked on as a party; and many of them becoming <hi>Curez</hi> did in their Pariſhes, as well as many other <hi>Curez</hi> broach <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s Doctrine, in <hi>Flaunders</hi> under the ſhelter of the Univerſity of <hi>Lovain</hi> and the forenamed Biſhops, and in <hi>France</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> (of which, as I ſaid, a very great part ſided with <hi>Janſenius)</hi> and alſo under the favour of ſome Biſhops of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This animoſity appeared greater; when Pope <hi>Urban,</hi> who was ſoon advertis'd of theſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, put out his Bull; which he did in <hi>March</hi> 1642. to ſuppreſſe <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Book: for then many unmaskt themſelves, and ſpoke plain, even againſt his Holineſſe Orders, in defence of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> though (as Pope <hi>Urbans</hi> Bulls ſpeak) <hi>Janſenius</hi> had renewed condemned Hereſies, and had incurred Excommunication by writing his Book, and treating in it matters forbidden to be treated of in print, that is, the matters called
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96350:18"/>
                  <hi>de Auxiliis,</hi> forbid by <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth to be treated of under pain of Excommunication. Pope <hi>Urban</hi> therefore ſent redoubled Briefs to ſuppreſſe the riſing Faction of <hi>the Janſenians,</hi> as in one of his Bulls he termeth them. Many ſubmitted to their duty. Yet all Pope <hi>Urbans</hi> time the Faction was very ſtrong; and though it decayed ſomething in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> yet it ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened daily in <hi>France,</hi> where it leaſt ought to have been received. For whereas <hi>Janſenius</hi> had writ a moſt bitter Invective againſt the Crown and Kings of <hi>France,</hi> called <hi>Mars Gallicus,</hi> it was to have been expected, that all faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Crown ought rather to have ſided againſt <hi>Janſenius,</hi> then for him. And this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Marande</hi> preſſeth much againſt the French Janſeniſts, in his Book dedicated to the King of <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1654. which we formerly mentioned: where a good part of his diſcourſe tendeth to ſhew, that Innovations in Religion are promoted by thoſe chiefly, who aim at Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in State.</p>
               <p>Things therefore being come to ſo great a height in <hi>France,</hi> that now Janſeniſme was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into a conſiderable body, which might in time prove formidable both to the Church and Crown, the Biſhops in their generall Aſſembly, or Synod at <hi>Paris,</hi> took the matter into their conſideration; and having well examined the Book of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> they collected Five Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of it, which ſeemed to them to deſerve a cenſure. The Propoſitions were theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some of Gods Commandments are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the Juſt, according to their preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96350:18"/>
though they have a will, and do endeavour to accompliſh them: and they want the Grace, that rendreth them poſſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſtate of Nature corrupt, men never reſiſt Interiour Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To merit and demerit in the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture corrupted, it is not neceſſary to have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that excludes neceſſity; but it ſuffices to have that liberty which excludes coaction or conſtraint.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Semipelagians admitted the neceſſity of Interiour preventing Grace to every Action, even to the beginning of Faith. But they were Heretiques in this, that they would have that Grace to be ſuch, as the will of man might reſiſt it, or obey it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is Semipelagianiſme to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt dyed, or ſhed his Blood generally for all men.</p>
               <p>Theſe Propoſitions the Biſhops drew out of <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Book; yet knowing themſelves to be but a Nationall Synod, they would not lay any cenſure upon them, but in the Year 1650. ſent them to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, humbly requiring him, that through his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall care of the Univerſall Church, he would determine what ought to be held; it belonging onely to him to define in this cauſe. This Letter was ſigned by eighty five Biſhops then preſent at the Aſſembly. The Pope thereupon took the matter into Examination, and deputed divers Divines to examine the Propoſitions, whom he often heard himſelf, the Deputies of the Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts being alſo preſent at <hi>Rome,</hi> and having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96350:19"/>
to ſpeak for themſelves, as they often did. At length, after two years examination of the matter, and many Prayers, Faſting, and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God, <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth proceeded to cenſure, and defined the ſaid Five Propoſitions to be Hereticall, by his Bull given on the laſt day of <hi>May</hi> 1653. This Bull is inſerted into the Bull of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh, which by and by I ſhall produce.</p>
               <p>But all this was not enough to make many of the Janſeniſts ſubmit. Upon ſight of the Bull they changed their note; and whereas before they had owned the Five Propoſitions to be in <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> but maintained them to be Catholique <hi>Tenents,</hi> and the true Doctrine of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> now they acknowledged the ſaid Five Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were juſtly cenſured by the Pope, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that they were not in <hi>Janſenius;</hi> yet whoſoever taught them, or whereſoever they were to be found, the Janſeniſts profeſſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them. By this means they thought both to clear themſelves from the cenſure of defending Hereticall Propoſitions, and withall ſtill to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> as they had done before: and ſo all the fault was to redound on the Pope, and the Synod of <hi>France,</hi> (as the Janſeniſts would have it thought) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> on thoſe who had informed them wrong, That the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> which indeed (ſaid they) were not there, at leaſt in the ſenſe, in which they were condemned. This Diſcourſe, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo frivolous, prevailed with many for their conſtant maintaining of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> ſo as it was feared, the whole endeavour of the Biſhops of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96350:19"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> and alſo the Conſtitution of the Pope, would at length come to nothing. To prevent this miſchief, the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> who were yet remaining in their Aſſembly at <hi>Paris,</hi> wrote this following Letter to the reſt of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops, that were abſent from the ſaid Aſſembly, and that it might be publique, cauſed it to be printed; which for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I have thought fit here to ſet down, tranſlated into Engliſh.</p>

For can there be any thing more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, then to maintain that, for the refuting whereof there is not required any reaſoning, any enquiry, or any thing elſe, then meerly the reading of the Popes Conſtitution; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideth all the matter.

               <p>Here they notifie to all the world, that they deputed Eight of their Body, (Four Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Four Biſhops) to re-examine the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and the places of <hi>Janſenius</hi> from whence they are taken; which the Deputies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found to agree in all things, they ſhewed the places to the whole Aſſembly, who being fully ſatisfied of the verity, (though they never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of the Popes Deſinition) have given it under their hands, that the Propoſitions are truly <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi>'s, and condemned in his ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Yet all this was not enough. The proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which bred the Hereſie, maintained it ſtill.

The Fourth, viz.</hi> That the Semipelagians admitted the neceſſity of Interiour preventing Grace to every Action, even to the beginning of Faith. But they were Heretiques in this, That they would have that Grace to be ſuch, as the will of man might reſiſt or obey it, <hi>We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to be falſe, and condemn it as ſuch.

                              <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s Doctrine taught in his Book of Frequent Communion.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Church is corruptible in her Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Diſcipline,</hi> that is, her Doctrine of Manners.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>That there is no other Rule, whereby to know Catholique Verities, but onely Tradition.</hi> So the Pope, and Councells, and Scriptures, and Theologicall Demonſtration, are excluded from being any rule of knowing Catholique Verities.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>That St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul <hi>are two Heads of the Church, which make but one.</hi>

                           <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Abſolution of the Prieſt gives not to the Penitent any thing elſe, but the Grace of an exteriour Reconciliation; but that it is the Canonicall Satisfaction, which gives juſtifying Grace, and revives the Soul: And that it is therefore onely that Confeſſion is neceſſary, that the Prieſt may ſet a proportionable Penance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>That the practiſe of Penance for all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Sins, (whether publique and ſcandalous, or private) is, according to the Fathers and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, to go thus. Firſt you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and demand Penance. Secondly the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is given.

Fourthly cometh Abſolution; which is immediately followed with the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or receiving of the Bleſſed Sacrament.

               <p>All this he hath in his Book of <hi>Frequent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> and the long Preface to it. This Book, when it firſt came out, was looked on by many, who judged of it onely by the Title, as a good and pious Work. But the Jeſuites at <hi>Paris,</hi> who diſcovered the malice of the above mentioned Maximes, preached and wrote againſt it; and at length it was condemned. By this the Ieſuites got the ill will of the Janſeniſts, and animated <hi>Port-Royall</hi> againſt them. Yet all good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques thanked the Jeſuits for having ſtood up for the Church, and hindred the conſequences which were like to have followed, and the errours, into which many were running unawares.</p>
               <p>Many things were writ to and fro. The Janſeniſts defending <hi>Arnauld,</hi> and the Jeſuites with other Catholiques impugning him. At length <hi>Arnauld</hi> (who beſides the above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned pernicious Maximes, held alſo for <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us)</hi> writ a little Tract called, <hi>The Second Letter of</hi> Monſieur Arnauld <hi>to a Duke and Peer of France,</hi> where he excuſes <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and the Janſeniſts from Hereſie, in the ſame manner which the Authour of the Provinciall Letters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96350:27"/>
held, to wit, by ſaying, that the Five Propoſitions could not be found in <hi>Janſenius;</hi> that it was matter of Fact, and not any Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall point, wherein the Janſeniſts and others diſagreed; and conſequently that they could not be called Heretiques. This Letter was after a long <hi>Examen</hi> of it condemned in the Sorbon; and <hi>Arnauld,</hi> refuſing to ſubmit, and further proteſting againſt the Determination of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, was caſhier'd the Sorbon, and had his Title of Doctour taken from him, in the Year 1656. the laſt of <hi>January,</hi> as appeareth by the Act then paſſed in Sorbon.</p>
               <p>This ſet the Janſeniſts in a rage. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hitherto they had defended themſelves with ſome ſhew of modeſty, and pretenſe of learning and piety, now they turned to write furious Satyrs (which they call <hi>Provinciall Letters)</hi> againſt the Sorbon firſt, then againſt the Dominicans; but their main fury they diſcharged againſt the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, whom they would needs imagine to be the Authors of all their diſgraces: of which they were ſo ſenſible, that they ſeem'd half deſperate. For now <hi>San-Cyrans</hi> wicked Maximes were laid open in the Information made againſt him; which <hi>Monſieur Preville</hi> printed. <hi>Janſenius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (I mean his Book) as Hereticall; and the laſt Pillar of Janſeniſme, <hi>Arnauld,</hi> was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniouſly turned out of <hi>Sorbon.</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT cannot be denied, that the Author of thoſe Letters, which are ſpread abroad againſt the Society, and fill the world with ſo much noiſe, is a Janſeniſt: If notwithſtanding it be the work of one ſingle man, and not rather of the whole party of the Janſeniſts. I conceive, that if the Author were queſtioned, and would anſwer truly to his name, he muſt uſe the ſame words which that Devil did, who tormented the

miſerable wretch that dwelt among the Tombs, and ſay, <hi>My name is Legion; for we are many.</hi> But howſoever, that the Author is a Janſeniſt, is manifeſt: For in his four firſt Letters he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth that Doctrine, which the Pope hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned under the name of <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: And in the following Letters he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Jeſuits with having been the firſt, that diſcovered and impugned thoſe hainous Errours, which make up <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Book.

And that they may have no better fortune in their Calumnies, then they met with in their wicked Doctrine, I hold it neceſſary to deſire the Readers, as well of thoſe Letters, as of this Writing, to conſider.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, the ſubtle and malicious wayes of the Janſeniſts; who (as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hinted) by a ſleight, very ordinary with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, have quitted their poſte in the ſight of the whole world, not giving now the leaſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to thoſe Reproaches made againſt them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the falſeneſſe of their Propoſitions challenged to be Erroneous, Scandalous, and Hereticall, which as defendants they ought to have maintained; but reproaching the Jeſuits with the wickedneſs of their Moral, by that means becomming the Aſſaulters, and obliging the others to the Defenſive part, in a matter which concerned not the queſtions in hand. Thus did the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96350:30"/>
Arians deal with great St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> when find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible to anſwer the force of his reaſons, they laid that care aſide, and became reproachers of his life, obliging him to juſtifie himſelf from thoſe horrible Accuſations, with which they ſet upon his innocency; accuſing him for raviſhing a woman, and barbarouſly murthering a man, that he might cut off his hand to uſe it in Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The queſtion was not here, what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Jeſuits have made, concerning ſundry <hi>Caſes of Conſcience,</hi> (which have either been propoſed to them, or which their Adverſaries have forged at their pleaſure, or (to ſpeak yet more truly) which the Enviers of their Glory and Abilities have maliciouſly attributed unto them) but of the Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and of the five Propoſitions taken out of that Author, and condemned <hi>as his</hi> by the holy See. That the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits have well or ill anſwered, or writ on the ſubject of Duels, Uſuries, Reſtitutions, and other Caſes, which their Adverſaries imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently impoſe on them, does not hinder the five Propoſitions taken out of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and preſented to the Pope by <hi>my Lords the Biſhops of France,</hi> from being condemned by the Holy See: Nor does it hinder thoſe, who now follow the Doctrine of the five Propoſitions, from being as much He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques as the Calviniſts of <hi>Charenton;</hi> or their Benifices (if they have any) from being vacant, (whether they have charge of Souls, or no) which they have now loſt by Hereſie: Nor if the Jeſuits ſhould be proved to erre in Morals, is it therefore forbid to ſay, the Janſeniſts are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; and that thoſe who know them to be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96350:31"/>
               <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> cannot in conſcience receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments from their hands. Nor does it hinder their Books from deſerving the fire and fagot, as well as their Perſons, if the Primitive ſeverity of our Laws were yet in uſe, and there were not ſome hope of their amendment. This the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of thoſe Letters ought to conſider, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the quality of their Authors; who being <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> are Heretiques, and, as ſuch, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemies of the Jeſuits: who have ſtill this advantage, that all thoſe, who are enemies to the Church, at the ſame time become theirs; like that which the Roman Oratour once ſaid of himſelf, <hi>'Twas the happineſs of his deſtiny, that never any became his Enemy, who was not at the ſame time an Adverſary likewiſe to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> This made a great Perſon of our times, and one who was a ſcourge of <hi>Janſeniſm,</hi> ſay, <hi>One ſhould give no other anſwer to thoſe wicked Letters, then theſe three words,</hi> Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts are Heritiques.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place conſider likewiſe, with how little diſcretion, or conſcience, the Writers of thoſe deteſtable Letters have cunningly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and authorized to the whole world certain pernicious Maximes, whileſt they charge the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits for having writ them in their Books. The Jeſuits Opinions whatſoever they were, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their own Volumes unknown to any but Schoolmen and Doctors, to whom ſuch Writings could do no harm, ſince they are the Cenſurers of them: and even in the ſame Volumes, the Jeſuits propoſe the different opinions, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

the Correctour of the other: whereas our <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt</hi> gathers all that he can make ſeem extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant out of many ſeverall places, and puts all together, expoſed to the eyes of ignorant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in the vulgar Language, to perſons unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of judging betwixt the falſe and the true, the profitable and dammageble, that which is to be received, and that which is not; caſting a ſtumbling-block in the blinde mans way to make him fall; and opening a Ciſtern without cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, contrary to the prohibition made us in <hi>Exodus.</hi> I know well enough, the malice of his intention was to create a Horror of the Jeſuits, by the malignity of the Doctrine which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes on them: but let him know, there is great danger, leſt he perſwade theſe untruths and wicked Maximes to many, under the authority of the Jeſuits name; to which the greateſt part of the world will give more credit, then to ſuch petty Buffoons as he is, who hath neither ſenſe, conſcience, nor authority. Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Jeſuites are in the univerſal good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all, except onely Heretiques, and ſome others who malice them; ſo that thinking to cry down ſuch Doctrines, they render them <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> by the Authority of the Jeſuits: who have another manner of repute in the world, then the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> whom every body knows to have been condemned as Heretiques; and it is no leſſe known that the Jeſuites have been the firſt, who opened their eyes againſt the Errours and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies both of <hi>Janſenius</hi> and the <hi>Janſeniſts;</hi> being of the number of thoſe in the Church, who have moſt of all fought againſt Hereſies, Liberti,

niſme, and Vice, in their Books, in their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits and Sermons, in their Diſputes and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Inſomuch, as it is commonly believed, that to be of the ſame judgement with the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, is to be Orthodox; even ſo far, that many will be eaſily perſwaded to receive for a lawfull Opinion, and for an unblamable Reſolution, in reſpect of their moral life and conduct, that which they ſhall underſtand to be the common opinion, and univerſall tenet of the Fathers of that Society. Therefore the Writer of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Letters cannot excuſe himſelf, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought into the whole Church of God, and eſpecially into <hi>France,</hi> a horrible ſcandall, and which deſerves puniſhment; ſlandering learned and vertuous Perſons by opprobious ſpeeches, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifications, lies, and calumnies; and ſeducing the ignorant, the weak and licentious, by a wicked Doctrine. By attributing this Doctrine to the Jeſuites, he has rendred it <hi>probable,</hi> through the credit theſe Fathers have with the greateſt part of the word, who will believe it upon their ſcore; and by caſting it in a vulgar Language among the people, he hath thrown a ſtone of offence; at which the weak will ſtumble, and the wicked au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize their unlawfull enterprizes; through this belief, that they can commit no ſin, whileſt they follow the judgement of ſo many, ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo vertuous Perſons, as are the Fathers of the Society.</p>

near twelve years ſince, againſt the Fathers of the Society of Jeſus; to which Work, the Author gave this Title, <hi>The Divinity of the Jeſuites.</hi> Out of this he has taken all the grand reproaches, which he makes againſt thoſe Fathers; quoting the very ſame Authors and Places, and uſing the ſame Forgeries, multiplying his Letters according to the ſhreads he picks up, that he may be able to make many Books out of that one: all that is his, is that now and then he addeth the names of two or three Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the reſt, he is careful enough not ſo much as to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the three Books, which were then written in anſwer to that ſuppoſed <hi>Moral,</hi> taking no notice of the anſwers which were made to the calumnies it contained; nor the entertainment that perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Book met with, which was a condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the flames, to be burnt by the hand of the Hangman; and this by the ſentence of one of the wiſeſt, and moſt Auguſt Parliaments in <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, do but caſt your eye on his Rhapſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Paſſages and Quotations, you ſhall finde nothing but untruths and calumnies; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it falſifying the greateſt part of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he alledges, and many times lying moſt bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impudently: making Authors ſay that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96350:33"/>
which they never dreamt; croping and hacking their words, and not producing them entire, to the end, that one may not underſtand their true ſenſe; purpoſely omitting the modifications and limitations which they uſe, to render them ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous or monſtrous in their opinions: fancying to himſelf, that having cited the places, quoted the Books, and written ſome of the Authours words, every one will credit him, though the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Morall Divinity</hi> has been convicted of falſity in the moſt of the ſelf-ſame Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Do but remember after what manner the Calviniſts (who have as little truth in their Quotations, as they have in their Faith) alledge the holy Scripture, and Sentences of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that falſhood is entailed on Hereſie; and that the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> have that Character of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in their Sect, that it is now become a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb in many places, when one would call one <hi>an impudent Liar,</hi> to ſay, That he over-reaches as much as a Janſeniſt. I know not what I ought to blame moſt in theſe men and their writings, whether their falſeneſs and impudence in lying, or their malice in inventing calumnies, or their ignorance in ſo ill underſtanding, and ſo ill al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of Authors and their Opinions; or their injuſtice, in forging crimes where there are none; or their inveterate hate againſt the Jeſuites, whom they ſet upon by falſe and unreaſonable accuſations.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, reflect on the manner of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors writing; who in matters of Divinity, of Morall, of Caſes of Conſcience, and Salvation, uſes a taunting fooliſh ſtile; I will not <hi>onely</hi>

ſay unworthy of a Divine, or an Eccleſiaſticall perſon, but even of a Chriſtian; who ought not to treat holy Things like a Scoffer or Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. He calls himſelf, as all of that Sect of his doe, <hi>Diſciple of St. Auguſtin:</hi> Let him finde me one place in the writings of that great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, where he takes upon him the part of a Jeaſter, or Buffoon. 'Tis the ſpirit of Hereſie, which has nothing in it of ſerious, but rage and fury; if yet notwithſtanding men ſwayed with thoſe paſſions deſerve to be termed ſerious: 'Tis the ſpirit of the ungodly and Blaſphemers, which is ſpoken of in <hi>Job, Imitaris linguam blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantium,</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt like a Blaſphemer: the Original bears <hi>Irriſorum,</hi> Thou haſt the tongue of Jeaſters.

            </p>
            <p>In the ſixth place, conſider the ill reaſoning of this malicious Writer, who often attributes to the whole Body of the Jeſuites, that which none of them has ſaid, or at moſt what eſcaped from ſome one of their Body, notwithſtanding that all the reſt have written againſt it. Who yet ever ſaw, that from one particular a man could conclude an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal? Muſt we call thoſe the Maximes, or the <hi>Moral</hi> of the Jeſuits, which were ſcarce ever ſaid by any one of the Jeſuits? If <hi>Gerſon</hi> Chancellour of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> have had ſome erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinion upon the difference of Venial and Mortall ſin, muſt we cenſure that as the Maxime, or the Moral of the Sorbon? <hi>Richerius</hi> had a particular Opinion, which was not approved, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſovereign Paſtour, muſt we therefore blame the whole Faculty? If any of the holy Fathers have had ſome opinion, which ſince his time hath not been approved, muſt we therefore attribute it to all the holy Fathers? Had this Authour but one grain of ſincerity, whileſt he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth one Jeſuit for advancing an opinion, which ſeems not true to him, why conceals he, that many other Jeſuites have taught the contrary? This Caveat he might have read in the Reply to the <hi>Moral Divinity;</hi> which we ſhall be conſtrained to make him read in the <hi>Second Anſwer,</hi> which will be made to his Letters, to his Falſities, and to his malicious Diſſimulations. I appeal to any judicious man, what is properly to be called the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96350:34"/>
Jeſuites Doctrine? whether that which onely one of that Body ſhall have ſaid, or that which many amongſt them have taught to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? and if it be not an inſupportable injuſtice, and which deſerves not to eſcape unpuniſhed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly to impute to a whole Community, not what the greateſt part have taught, but what one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of them has ſaid? Were it not injuſtice to impeach the whole Colledge of the Apoſtles for Treaſon, becauſe one of their number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his Maſter?</p>
            <p>Finally, let any man judge whether it be not a loud calumny and groſſe foolery to charge the Jeſuites as Introducers, and firſt Authors, or ſole defenders of opinions, which were taught for many Ages in all the Univerſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> before the Order of the Jeſuites was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They call Opinions and Maximes of the Jeſuites, thoſe very aſſertions which have been, and are the opinions of others, and which the greateſt part of the Ieſuites oppoſe in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as may be ſeen in the Anſwer to the Book called <hi>Morall Divinity.</hi> But all that is odious muſt be caſt upon the Ieſuites: they are uſed by their enemies, (ſuch as are commonly Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and the followers of <hi>Janſeniſme)</hi> as the Primitive Chriſtians were by the Heathens; for as to thoſe it was crime enough to be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſo to theſe 'tis enough to be a Ieſuite, to lie under the laſh of every ones cenſure, when there is power, and impunity. That which is paſt by in ſome Writers, and which is not ſo much as a light fault in the Books of others, is in the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites a crime, an attempt againſt publique Order,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96350:35"/>
an abomination. The Authour of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters does not reproach the Ieſuites with any one Maxime, Deciſion, or Anſwer, which is not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſly alledged by that Impoſtor, or corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted and diſguiſed, or ſo ſeparated from its own place, from its modifications and limitations, that it is no more the ſame. If any opinion, that ſeemeth to give ſcope to Liberty, be taught by any of the Society, it is oppoſed by many others of the ſame body: Nay, whatſoever any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon of the Society hath advanced contrary to the ſentiments of the reſt of his Order, that very ſame hath been formerly taught by many Doctours, out of his Order, in all Univerſities, and by many famous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Maſters of the Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> of other Schools, and many times of the Sorbon it ſelf. This I ſay, to the end you may know, that what they attribute to the Ieſuites, belongs leſſe to them then to others; and that oftentimes the Doctrine, which this good Fellow would make paſſe as ridiculous, falſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to good manners, is not ſuch in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many great Doctours, whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt countervail in Schools. It is theſe we are bound to credit, more then Heretiques, and people that know neither ſpeculative, nor poſitive Divinity; and far more then an ignorant Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon, good for nothing, but to jeaſt and play the Comedian, as is the Author of theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; who, as himſelf vouches, is neither Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, nor Caſuiſt, nor Clergy-man; and cannot deny but that he is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anſeniſt, and by a neceſſary conſequence an Heretique, ſince all Janſeniſts are ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:96350:35"/>
Whence comes it then, that he ſets upon the Ieſuites, rather then upon other Writers that teach the ſame? Hence, that it is the cuſtome of Heretiques to be more againſt this Body, then againſt all the reſt: It is alſo a badge of this Society to be perſecuted by all the Wicked; ſhe hath been ſo dealt withall from her very Cradle, and ſhall be, ſo as long as ſhe makes profeſſion of pure Doctrine, and true Vertue. If this ſleeveleſs Writer had had a zeal for the Truth, or a juſt horror of falſe Doctrine, he would have fought againſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, where ever he had found it, and would have ſided with thoſe who maintained Truth, as the Ieſuits do. But it is apparent enough, it was not the love of Truth made him write, but the hatred of it; under pretence of oppoſing the evil Doctrine of the Ieſuits, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf on them, (although it were to the prejudice of Truth and his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if yet he have any) for their accuſing the Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> which has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Heretical. But he has a Bone to pick; he will never perſwade the world, that the Doctrine of the Ieſuites deſerves condemnation, ſince it is that which carries on the War againſt Hereſie, Errour, and Libertiniſme. Therefore the Iudicious laught at his Letters, the honeſt Party deteſted them, and the Ignorant were ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized. On the contrary, the Heretiques hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, and Libertines adored them, Buffoons owned their ſtile in them, Port Royall their Characters, and Ianſeniſts their mode of cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and vainly anſwering the juſt reproaches
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96350:36"/>
made to their wicked Doctrine: After all this the Ieſuites will not be without an Anſwer, the Church without Cenſures, nor the Magiſtrates without Puniſhment, ſo ſoon as this wicked Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall have publiſhed his Name; in conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which he cannot diſſemble his being a Janſeniſt, and by conſequence an Heretique.</p>

               <p>THe Author of the Provincial Letters chargeth the Fathers of the Society of Jeſus, that they have brought into the world opinions in matter of Morality, which corrupt the manners of Chriſtians. To make good this charge, he inſtanceth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes, from the beginning of his fifth Letter (where he entereth upon his grand deſign of impugning the Society) to the end of the tenth; in all which he will have it clear, that the Society hath introduced a <hi>Moral,</hi> which breedeth corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the whole world. To prove this charge, he ought to make good four things in the inſtances which he alledgeth. The firſt is, that the Doctrine, againſt which he inveigheth, is not ancienter then the Society. For if it were taught in the Church by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authors, before that Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was in being, it is falſe to charge the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96350:37"/>
with introducing it. Secondly, when he chargeth them with any Doctrine, he muſt cite their words truly, according to the plain ſenſe of the Authors. Thirdly, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine wherewith he chargeth the Society, muſt be naught and unallowable; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he doth but ſhew his own either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or malice, and deſerveth to be caſt out of the Schools, for cenſuring and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good and wholeſome Doctrine. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he must ſhew, that the Doctrine which he objecteth to the whole Order, is not onely the private <hi>Tenent</hi> of one or two ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in it, but taught by many, or at leaſt allowed by many, and generally owned by the Society. For it is falſe to call that the Doctrine of a Religious Order, which (though one or two have held) is generally diſclaimed by the whole Body.</p>
               <p>That theſe four things ought to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is ſo unqueſtionable, that no rationall man will diſpute it. I reflect on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are thoſe, by which the Authour of this Anſwer evidently convinceth the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, though he do no where ſet down theſe conditions: And I do defie all the Janſeniſts, and all their <hi>Cabal,</hi> to make theſe four Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions good in any one of all the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96350:37"/>
of Caſes, which theſe Letters object. It is eaſie to object great crimes to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt innocency; it is eaſie to rail and taunt, when Spleen and Choler furniſh words to Fury: But let them come to the point, and prove what they ſay, and then Ile give them leave to boaſt, and pardon all their Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domontadoes.</p>
               <p>The Societies Anſwer is their Innocency: There is not one objection of all that are made in this Book, which is rightly made; not one, by which the Society may be made guilty of corrupt Doctrine. Here are nine and twenty Impoſtures laid open; there might have been as many more: but theſe are enough to let the world ſee, that this man deſerveth no credit, who in ſix Letters is convinced of twenty nine Impoſtures. The whole Machin of the Objections, made in the Provincial Letters, is mainly built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Doctrine of <hi>Probable Opinions;</hi> which (though the Church hath alwayes allowed) this Letter-writer, and his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour into Engliſh (who will needs become his Second) call a <hi>Monſter,</hi> and <hi>Source of Irregularities.</hi> I will therefore put that in the firſt place, and ſet the reſt of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers down, as near as may be, in the ſame

order, as the Objections (all which are <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures)</hi> do lye in the Provincial Letters, that the Reader may eaſily turn to them. I invert the order a little, in which they are printed in the French; but it is to facilitate the matter.</p>

                     <p>This is no new Impoſture; for 'tis one part of the firſt Propoſitions in the <hi>Morall Divinity,</hi> which is falſely imputed to the Jeſuites: and as Father <hi>Cauſſin</hi> ſayes, <hi>'Tis the Head of that Book, (a weak, yet malignant Head) which hath an influence into the whole Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every one knows, that in Morall Theology, as in other Sciences which are taught in the Schools, there are two ſorts of Maximes. The one, in which all Caſuiſts generally agree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe either Holy Scriptures, or conſent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Doctours have made them certain and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96350:38"/>
evident. The other onely probable, and ſuch as may fall under diſpute, and in which opinions of Authors are divided.</p>
                     <p>For what concerns the firſt ſort of Maximes, no man can deny them without temerity; and commonly there are none that diſagree with the Ieſuites in them, but Heretiques. As to the ſecond, 'tis lawful for any one to pick and chuſe out of thoſe ſeverall different opinions, which Divines teach, that which ſquares beſt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſuppoſing it be <hi>probable;</hi> that is, that it be accompanied with theſe four conditions, which <hi>Suarez</hi> a Ieſuit hath <note n="a" place="bottom">

                     <p>The firſt is, that it doth not ſtrike at thoſe Truths, which are univerſally received in the Church. The ſecond, that it doth not wound common ſenſe. The third, that it be grounded on reaſon, and maintained by ſome irreproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Authority. The fourth, that if it hath not the generall vote of the Doctours, at leaſt it be not generally condemned.</p>
                     <p>This is <hi>the Doctrine of Probable Opinions;</hi> This, that which the <hi>Janſeniſt</hi> calls, <hi>The Source of Irregularities:</hi> This, <hi>the Stumbling-block</hi> of this Brain-ſick Man.

                     <p>This is the naked truth: and now you ſhall ſee the impoſture and treachery of the Janſeniſt, which would give ſubject enough of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it were not ſo natural to him, that they are inſeparable.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, to render this Doctrine obnoxious to a ſevere cenſure, he explains it indifferently of all ſorts of occaſions; as if theſe Authours thought, that any one, on never ſo ſlight motives, might caſt himſelf into the danger of offending God: whereas <hi>Baſil Pontius</hi> ſpeaks only of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary caſes, where either the intereſt of ſtate, or Religion, is concerned.

Secondly, to render the Jeſuites odious, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to them that opinion, becauſe one of them followed it; although their more able Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as <hi>Suarez,</hi> hold the contrary. Is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> this a plain ſign, that paſſion has blinded him?

Now to all this, though Father <hi>Bauny</hi> do approve the Doctrine, yet is it ſo falſe, that he approves the manner of ſpeaking of <hi>Baſil Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> that he repeats the contrary four times in the fourteenth queſtion of <hi>the Treatie of Penance,</hi> that if one ſhould engage himſelf in the occaſion of ſinning upon ſome juſt account, <hi>that occaſion muſt not be either pretended, or ſought after, by him, who does ſo expoſe himſelf.</hi>

                  <p>IT is ſtrange to ſee how the Jeſuites reconcile (by the interpretation of ſome term) the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties which are between their opinions, and the Deciſions of Popes, Councels, and of Holy Scripture.

                     </p>
                     <p>What is an <hi>Aſaſſin,</hi> according to the terms of Law? <hi>Such a one,</hi> ſayes that Father, <hi>as is hired for money to kill a man by Ambuſcade, when he thinks not on't. Therefore he is not called an</hi> Aſaſſin, <hi>who kills another without any ſet price, but onely to do his friend a courteſie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two Interpretations will not pleaſe the Janſeniſt.

But why? he gives us no reaſon: for 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough, he can have none but his ignorance in the moſt common terms of Law.</p>
                     <p>For the word <hi>treacherouſly,</hi> he need onely open the Books of the Caſuiſts, and Interpreters of Law, to learn the true meaning of it; and ſince <hi>Diana</hi> is ſo much his friend, I will ſend him to that Treatie, <hi>De Immunitate Eccleſiarum,</hi> with which he begins the firſt Tome of his Works.

which this Calumniatour caſts on the moſt eminent Authors, are much of the ſame nature with this I now handle; and to obſerve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that a man may abuſe this Maxime, (That the Intention maketh the work good or bad) as a man may alſo abuſe the beſt Maximes in Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But the Janſeniſt was obliged to prove, that the Authours, whom he cenſures, have effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted it, in perverting it to wicked ends, from which he is far enough off: ſince that in all the Letters, in which he pretends to condemn the Divines, there is not any one reaſon to be found, which he makes uſe of to ſhew their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; nor any one Author, that he citeth to prove his own opinion. All the arguments of this learned Caſuiſt are reduced to theſe two, Raillery and Falſeneſſe.

For if St.</hi> Auguſtin <hi>for theſe cauſes doth hardly allow one to kill another, for defence of his own life, how much leſſe would he allow it in this caſe for defence of ones ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?

                     </p>
                     <p>Now tell me what a groſſe Impoſture is this, to make <hi>Leſſius</hi> Authour of that which he doth not teach? Nay, which he impugneth? What a cheat to attribute to him the words of <hi>Victoria, Etiam cum gladio?</hi> and to make the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96350:78"/>
culpable of favouring Revenge, becauſe <hi>Leſſius</hi> citeth the words of <hi>Victoria</hi> a Dommi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, which this Fellow conceiteth to favour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? In fine, what a loud untruth is it to ſay, That <hi>Leſſius</hi> teacheth in this place, that you may kill him that hath given you a Box o'th' Ear, when it is not ſo much as queſtioned in this place, whether you may kill him, but whether you may ſtrike, or wound him! and when never an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, here cited, alloweth that you may kill him. Finally, when <hi>Leſſius</hi> alloweth not the very ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or purſuing him, for fear of exceſſe, and killing him. Had not, thinkyou, all thoſe men of honour in <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſaw this paſſage in <hi>Leſſius,</hi> a great deal of reaſon to judge the authour of ſo unworthy an Impoſture, to be a man of no c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>edit, but a meer Calumniatour?</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Leſſius</hi> ſaith <hi>it is ſpeculative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable,</hi> that one may return the blow; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Leſſius</hi> teacheth this opinion of theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. I anſwer firſt, that though he did teach the opinion of theſe authors, yet he could not be challenged to teach, that one may kill in this <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contre;</hi> for none of them, as here they are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, teacheth, That one may kill in this caſe. Secondly, I anſwer that he doth not teach even this Opinion. To make my anſwer clear, I muſt tell you a ſhort paſſage. A man having his arm gangren'd, and being adviſed to cut it off to ſave his life, ſent for four able Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons to give their opinion. The three firſt were of opinion, that the Patient muſt have his arm cut off and they gave many reaſons for their opinion. The fourth ſpake thus to the Patient,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96350:79"/>
The three, who have given their opinion for the cutting off your arm, have reaſoned well, and I hold their opinion ſpeculatively probable, but for my part I would not eaſily allow, that in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice you ſhould cut off your arm. When this fourth man had given his opinion in theſe words, he gave divers reaſons, why the arm ſhould not be cut off. Now I ask you, whether this fourth man were of opinion, that the Patient ſhould cut off his arm? Every one will anſwer, that certainly he was not: and I anſwer the ſame of <hi>Leſſius.</hi> Certainly he teacheth not that one may ſtrike or wound another for a Box o'th' Ear, much leſſe that he may kill; but the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he alloweth not to ſtrike or wound, for fear of killing, and for the other reaſons he alledgeth. How then can any man dream, that he teacheth one may kill him?</p>
                     <p>Now as to the ſecond Aſſertion, that <hi>Leſſius</hi> is charged with, that <hi>to prevent a Box o'th' Ear, one may kill him that would give it you;</hi> and that in the place cited, <hi>n.</hi> 77. he teacheth this to be ſure <hi>ex ſententiâ omn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h them, in the following number, for another buſineſſe. But in this number he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the words, nor the ſenſe of the words. But I will not inſiſt on this; 'tis too ſmall a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96350:79"/>
to be taken notice of among ſo many notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impoſtures. To come then to the point. <hi>Leſſius</hi> in the place cited teacheth, That a man of Honour may reſiſt an Invaſor, that would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cudgel or box him, and that he may kill him that ſetteth upon him, if he cannot otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf from being baſtinado'd or buffeted: and this he teacheth, after <hi>Sotus, Navarr, Sylveſter, Ludovicus Lopez, Gomez,</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> whereof none are Jeſuites. Now that for which I complain of the Janſeniſt here, is firſt, That he would have it thought the Jeſuites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or mainly ſpread this opinion, when in the place he citeth, his own eyes are witneſſes, that it is the opinion of ſo many others before <hi>Leſſius</hi> wrote. Secondly, I complain of his want of wit, that he would tax this opinion, which is a good one. For what? Would you have a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman cudgell'd and kickt in the Ken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>el, for fear that if he ſhould keep off ſome inſolent ribauld, he might at length be forced to draw his Sword, and perhaps whileſt he defendeth himſelf, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to kill his injurious Invaſour? <hi>For he muſt not kill him if can avoid it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Leſſius.</hi> His words are, <hi>Fas eſt viro honorato occidere invaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, qui fuſtem vel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that as ſoon as you ſee a man lift up his cudgel againſt you, you may preſently piſtol him. No, but if you cannot, neither with fair words, nor threats, nor thruſting him off, nor any other way keep your ſelf from his cudgel, you are not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96350:80"/>
bound to ſtand ſtill, and let your ſelf be cudgel'd, and perhaps kill'd too; but you may lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your ſelf from him, that thus ſetteth upon you, though in the ſtrife his death ſhould follow your juſt defence. That this is the meaning of all the Divines, who teach this caſe, is evident; and as for <hi>Leſſius,</hi> his words make his meaning clear: for he concludeth thus, <hi>Si alitèr haec ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominia vitari non poteſt: If this ignominy</hi> of being box'd or cudgell'd, <hi>cannot otherwiſe be avoided.</hi> This Doctrine I will give the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatour leave to call <hi>Sterling,</hi> but not in deriſion. And if he be a Gentleman, I aſſure my ſelf, he will be ſorry for having quarrelled with <hi>Leſſius</hi> for this opinion; and be angry with thoſe, who engaged him to employ a good pen in ſo ill a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The third aſſertion, wherewith <hi>Leſſius</hi> is taxed in this matter, is that he teacheth, That <hi>one may kill another for reproachfull words, and even for a ſimple geſture, or ſign of contempt.</hi> The place quoted is in the ſame Book and Chapter, and the ſame Dubitation already cited, and num. 78. where <hi>Leſſius</hi> indeed treateth this matter.

For no private man can have right to defend himſelf by the publique ruine; and if that which ſeemeth my right, deſtroy the publique, then I have no right.

How falſe this Proteſtation is, and how juſtly the infamy (which he wiſheth) doth fall on his Writings, the Reader will plainly ſee, if exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Leſſius</hi> his words, he reflect firſt, That <hi>Leſſius</hi> never uſeth thoſe words, <hi>Etiam cum gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio,</hi> but onely citeth them in <hi>Victoria.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>Leſſius</hi> followeth in <hi>Practice,</hi> that is in effect and indeed, the contrary opinion to <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> though he allow (not to <hi>Victoria</hi>'s particular expreſſions, but) to the twelve Authors cited, ſo much as to ſay, their reaſons make their opinion ſpeculatively probable. Thirdly, That <hi>Leſſius</hi> doth not teach, that one may kill for contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words, or ſigns of contempt, but the quite contrary, in the very place which the Janſeniſt alledgeth. Fourthly, That the Maxime, <hi>Heed muſt be taken, that the practice of this Maxime prove not prejudiciall to the State; for then it is not to be permitted,</hi> is notoriouſly <hi>altered and diſtracted</hi> (to uſe his own words) from the ſenſe of the paſſage. The Janſeniſt citeth it out of num. 78. and <hi>Leſſius</hi> hath not it there, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not quite unlike it in <hi>num.</hi> 82. The Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt by the tenour of his diſcourſe applieth it to the caſes of killing for a Box o'th' Ear, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probious ſpeeches, or ſigns of contempt; and to that end quoteth the number 78. that it may ſeem a caution, annexed to thoſe opinions, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that number. And <hi>Leſſius</hi> hath no ſuch thing there; but in the number 82. in the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a queſtion, which the Janſeniſt himſelf in his thirteenth Letter, acknowledgeth to be of a quite different nature. Nor will it avail the Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt to endeavour to prove, that <hi>Leſſius,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96350:83"/>
an opinion probable in ſpeculation, holdeth alſo, that it is probable in practice, as he doth in his 13. Letter. For that were to prove that <hi>Leſſius</hi> doth hold that probable in practice, which he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently doth not hold probable in practice. That which the Janſeniſt ought to have done, was to ſhew, that he had cited <hi>Leſſius</hi> right; which is matter of fact, and to be atteſted by <hi>Leſſius</hi> his own words, (if there were any ſuch) not by the Ianſeniſts Chymerical conſequences from <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> to <hi>practicall,</hi> nor from other authors opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This that I have done to clear <hi>Leſſius,</hi> I might alſo do to vindicate the other authours, whom the Ianſeniſt wrongeth as evidently, as <hi>Molina, Vaſquez, Sanchez, Filiucius,</hi> and others; but that would be to make a great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume: and I conceive the Reader will be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this one example, that this Ianſeniſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſincerity, and citations of authours are utterly falſe.

But finding time ſlip away, and my ſelf obliged to give an account of the condition of that friend, (whom you have ſo often recommended to me, and who has nothing of Feminine in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides vertue) I have taken a pen; and as if I would have writ in ſpilling ink on the paper, I have writ at one daſh all that which follows.—Sir, That you may be aſſured of me, I will tell you in ſuch manner, as if I gave you my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

my imaginations, to my paſſions; which tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh immediately, and like clouds veil the beſt productions of the ſoul.

Even I my ſelf, that offer you it, ſee ſcarce any thing that I can call by a name. I know nothing, but that vaſt unlimited, yet certain and unmoveable propenſion I have to love and honour you; the which I ſhall be carefull enough not to limit by any thing ſince I would perſwade my ſelf, that I am in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of a Radicall (I had almoſt ſaid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall) Love, having reſpect to ſomething Divine, and to God, in whom Love is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For I pretend, that my Love to you is infuſed into the ſubſtance of my heart, into the very Center and Quinteſſence of my ſoul: which being infinite, both in time, and in your vertue of acting, as he is, of whom the ſoul is an image, I may boldly ſay, I am capable to operate towards you with Love, as God does towards men. For I have alwayes more power to act and love efficaciouſly, then I could be thought to have by my actions. In this there is nothing incredible, if a man know, 'tis for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96350:108"/>
love of your excellent vertues, that I make this ſo admirable vow. Can any one finde fault with me in offering you the Center of my Heart, <hi>you being, as you are, one ſelf ſame thing with God?</hi> Can any complain, that I expreſſe the inclinations I have for you, in a language unknown to the greateſt part of the world, which will laugh at it as ſtrange and barbarous; becauſe they know not, what it is to to love God and man after ſo high a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</q>

a precept commanding us to love God. The reaſon of it is, becauſe that act of loving God is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſalvation, according to St. <hi>John, He that loveth not, ſhall remain in death.</hi> Now all things which are <hi>neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> are commanded us.</p>

ſtand ſtill palpable Impoſtures; and are not at all defended, but rather made more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by the Janſeniſts endeavouring a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And they ſtanding ſo, the Fathers of the Society have their intent; which was to declare, that the Doctrine of the Society is falſely calumniated, being in its ſelf, as it lyeth in their approved Authours, good and ſolid Doctrine: and onely made to appear bad by the falſe Citations and Forgeries of the Janſeniſts; who are convinced not to have cleared themſelves, either of Impoſture or Hereſie.</p>

               <p>I Have attentively read over your Eleventh Letter; in which (though written for your vindication) I have not obſerved any thing, but what turns to your diſhonour, and produces an effect clean contrary to what you aim at. For ſo defective it is, that of the many Reproaches, which the Jeſuites have with reaſon faſtened upon you, you onely touch that of <hi>Raillery,</hi> which is the leaſt of the crimes you are charged with. Nay, I find it in truth ſo weak a piece, that inſtead of waſhing away that ſtain, it makes you even to condemn your ſelf, and renders you yet further culpable.</p>

You could not be ignorant, Sir, that thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers accus'd you of reviving, in your firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the errours of Janſenius, condemned by the whole Church; of ſporting your ſelf inſolently with the Cenſure of Sorbon, which did but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that of the Pope and Biſhops. Whence comes it then you anſwer not that Accuſation, but becauſe the Crime is ſo manifeſt to the whole world, that you cannot clear your ſelf; and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſo pleaſing to you, that you have no will to repent of it?</p>
               <p>You know they have convinc'd you of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence and Colluſion with <hi>Geneva;</hi> clearly proving the conformity of your Impoſtures and Calumnies, with thoſe which <hi>Du Moulin</hi> publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his <hi>Traditions against the Roman Church.</hi> You cannot pretend, that you had not heard of this, till you were cloſing up your Letter; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the writing which convinces it, was made publique a whole moneth before, though you would not take notice of it.

               <p>Theſe are the Crimes you had been charged with, before the laſt Anſwer of the Jeſuits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining your Impoſtures; and which, without doubt, you would never have diſſembled, but that you found it impoſſible, to make any paſſable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to it.

               <p>I might, Sir, let you fly with confuſion, and in diſorder, without troubling my ſelf to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you; but ſeeing you witneſſe by your cry, that you are wounded and grown ſenſible of the ſmart, I am glad to underſtand the cauſe of it, and to try if I can comfort you.</p>
               <p>You complain firſt, that you have for a long while been perſecuted with injurious language; and you ſeem ſolicitous to inform the world, wherefore you are treated in that manner. You ſhould do better, Sir, to undeceive your ſelf, and call to minde that you ſuffer little in reſpect of what you have merited; ſince having for a long
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96350:135"/>
time exercis'd the patience of others, it is but juſt that you practiſe it your ſelf at laſt, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during thoſe reproaches which cannot be forborn you, without betraying Religion, and abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the innocence of thoſe you have calumniated. You are much to blame, Sir, to take an act of juſtice for an injury; they are not injuries, but truths, that have been told you to repell your Calumnies: and you know, there are no better weapons to beat down falſhood and errour, (whoſe Secretary you glory to be) then thoſe of Truth, which you have raſhly withſtood.</p>
               <p>If one terms you Heretique, 'tis but after the whole Church has call'd you ſo; which cannot be miſtaken: and 'tis an article of Faith, That <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s opinions touching Grace, being (as all the world knows) condemn'd and fulminated by the Church, all the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> that perſiſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in their defence, as you do, are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</p>

               <p>If one reproach you for being a Scoffer, 'tis indeed a ſhamefull quality for a <hi>Cenſurer</hi> of <hi>Morality;</hi> but you have drawn it on your ſelf, by thoſe injurious Satyres you have learnt in <hi>Calvins School,</hi> and which you pretend to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>by the example of the Saints, and of God himſelf.</hi>

In fine, if a man charge you with Gullery and Impoſture, 'tis but after an Ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; which yet by blaſting and tearing your Book of <hi>Morall Theology,</hi> as an infamous and ſcandalous Libell, has not been able to deter you from filling your Letters with thoſe old calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this you ſee, Sir, that the reproaches caſt upon you being juſt, your complaints cannot be reaſonable; and that being condemn'd as a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniatour</hi> by voice of the Judges, 'tis but in vain to ſeek to be treated as <hi>Innocent</hi> in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe how unjuſt ſoever that pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, wherewith you flatter your imagination, I can affirm, that the proofs (whether generall or particular) whereon you think to build your juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, are ſo extreamly ruinous, that had you not told us you intended an <hi>Apology,</hi> I ſhould have been perſwaded by your reaſons, that you meant to make a publique confeſſion of all your <hi>Impoſtures.</hi>

               <p>In fine, the laſt reaſon you bring to remove the ſuſpicion of your Impoſtures, is, that though it be hard to come to the knowledge of you, <hi>'tis an eaſie matter to diſcover the falſities you are guilty of,</hi> ſeeing the moſt ſimple are capable of it; and that they who have not ſtudied ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to penetrate queſtions of <hi>Right,</hi> have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light enough to judge of queſtions of <hi>Fact.</hi>

               <p>I ask you, Sir, from what words of <hi>Vaſquez</hi> you can infer, that according to his Doctrine, one needs onely be <hi>ambitious</hi> to have nothing <hi>ſuperfluous?</hi> I ask you, if this be a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Vaſquez <hi>aſſures with</hi> Cajetan, <hi>that men call not that ſuperfluous which the rich lay up to raiſe their condition by lawfull wayes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis as ſafe, according to</hi> Vaſquez, <hi>to have ambition enough, that ſo you may have nothing ſuperfluous, as it is ſafe, according to the Goſpel, to have no ambition at all, that ſo you may give alms of your ſuperfluity?</hi> Where does <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſay, <hi>'Tis a ſure way to have ambition enough, that ſo one may have nothing ſuperfluous?</hi> Where do you finde that to raiſe ones fortune by wayes that are juſt and lawfull, is <hi>to be ambitious?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be true, that herein conſiſts a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Fact;</hi> if it be clear, that theſe two are the falſhoods you ſtand accuſed of; if it be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that in caſe you be culpable thereof, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all contradiction you are, you have impos'd on <hi>Vaſquez;</hi> and finally if it be indubitable, that to diſcharge your ſelf of this crime, you were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd either to excuſe or deny it: Is it not alſo certain, that you have done neither? But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how ſhould you be able to do it, except you could make impoſſibility poſſible? Can you ſay
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96350:139"/>
that theſe words, <hi>Statum quem licitè poſſunt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirere</hi> are not in the place I cite you? Can you affirm, that you have quoted them in the ſixth Letter? Nay, can you aſſure us, that you have mentioned them in the twelfth?</p>
               <p>So far you are from clearing your ſelf, that you afreſh commit two great and unpardonable falſities. You averre, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> obliges not the rich to part with what is neceſſary to their condition. This is the firſt. And that he teaches that they are not oblig'd either in <hi>juſtice</hi> or <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to give of their <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi> much leſſe of that which is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> in all the ordinary wants of the poor, and that they are not bound to give of their <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but in ſuch occaſions as ſeldom or never happen. This is the ſecond.</p>

               <p>He ſayes, numb. 13. againſt <hi>Gabriel, Major,</hi> and <hi>Gerſon,</hi> who teach that the rich are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to give alms, but in extream neceſſities, <hi>That this opinion is rightly rejected by other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, becauſe ſuch neceſſity is very rare; it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happening that any one is found in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neceſſity.

               <p>What is then the point of our diſpute?

               <p>Look to your ſelf, Sir; reflect on your Letter: ſee how you cite <hi>Tannerus,</hi> and reckon, if you pleaſe, all the faults I ſhall note to you. <hi>See,</hi> ſay you, <hi>his Doctrine not unlike that of</hi> Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. <hi>There is properly and truly no Simony, but when a temporall good is received as the price of aſpirituall: But when it is taken as a motive, inclining a man to beſtow the ſpirituall; or as an acknowledgement of being already beſtowed, it is no Simony, at leaſt in point of conſcience.

You ſee what it is to acquire ill habits. But this is not all.

               <p>'Tis true, this Propoſition is in <hi>Tannerus,</hi> but it is as true, that you have not given it intire; which ſhews your unſincere practice: for you have lopt off this enſuing part, which is eſſentiall to its deciſion. <hi>Eſto quidem tali commutatione grave peccatum committatur, ac ſimul in caſibus jure expreſſis Simonia, ſaltem juris poſitivi, incurra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>

You have been convinced of cutting off by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle two of <hi>Tannerus</hi>'s Propoſitions at a blow; of leaving out one part of the Text, to conclude from the other which remained imperfect, that according to this <hi>Authour</hi> it is neither Simony nor ſin, to give a <hi>ſpirituall good for a temporall,</hi> if one give it not as the <hi>price,</hi> but onely as the <hi>motive:</hi> And yet in the other part of the ſame Text, which you maliciouſly retrenched, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the clean contrary; <hi>that what he ſaid in the firſt,</hi> (by you cited) <hi>according to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of St.</hi> Thomas, (mark, Sir, <hi>exmente D.

               <p>He here asks the queſtion, whether he that turns Bankrupt, may by that action free himſelf from the bond of making reſtitution? And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers firſt, <hi>that in point of conſcience it excuſes him no more then neceſſity alone would do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; becauſe though he breaks, yet no more is allow'd him then meer aliment, and that too by way of compaſſion; for it is not alwayes grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but onely when the caſe ſeems to deſerve it, as is preſcribed in the Law,</hi> qui bonis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly he anſwers, that in the exteriour Tribunall <hi>Ceſſion,</hi> or the act of breaking, works two effects. The firſt, <hi>That one cannot impriſon the Debtour,</hi> which he proves by the L. 1. C. <hi>qui bonis cedere poſſunt.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>That one cannot take from him what he acquires after his breaking, if it be neceſſary for the maintenance of himſelf and family,</hi> which he ſhews by the Law, L. <hi>is qui bonis</hi> 4. &amp; § <hi>ult.

               <p>
                  <hi>It follows, that he who not by his own fault is conſtrained to break, if his Creditours ſeize on his goods, may retain as much as is neceſſary for him to live meanly, according to his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (ut tenuiter vivat ſecundum ſtatum) as</hi> Navarre <hi>and others teach; who aſſert, that one may retain as much as is requiſite to live on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out want; that is, as</hi> Sylv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

You will ask, whether the Laws permit the ſame, as to the goods he had when he was upon the point of breaking. It ſeemes to be inferrable out of the Law,</hi> qui bonis <hi>

               </p>
               <p>See you not, Sir, how accuſable you are for omitting theſe words? See you not the great difference he puts between thoſe that break through ſome misfortune, which renders them not criminall, but miſerable; and thoſe who engaging themſelves in reſtitutions by their crimes and injuſtices, become miſerable after they have made themſelves criminall? The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Debtour may retain part of his goods, even of thoſe he had before he became Bankrupt, to live meanly according to his condition, <hi>ut tenuiter vivat ſecundum ſtatum,</hi> to live without diſhonour, <hi>ne indecore vivat;</hi> (thus you ſhould have tranſlated theſe words, but it were an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe work to rectifie you) The criminall Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, on the contrary, may retain part of the goods he gets after turning Bankrupt: and this the Text you alledge, ſpecifies; but not of thoſe he had gotten before Bankrupt, by rapines and publick extortions: which you falſly impute to him in your eighth Letter, and deſiſt not from doing it again in your twelfth, notwithſtanding he affirms the contrary in the place I cite you; aſſerting that he is obliged to reſtore without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and to reduce himſelf to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

things were ſaid <hi>to divert the Author</hi> from falſifying and abuſing learned Writers, which he doth not underſtand. They were ſaid <hi>to divert</hi> him from ſtealing calumnies out of condemned Libells. They were ſaid <hi>to divert</hi> him from Hereſies.

It is no friendly part to be glad, that one, for whom you have a kindeneſſe, ſaith what he cannot prove, and undertakes what he cannot perform: yet you are glad to ſee this in your Friend, which another man would be aſhamed of in a Stranger. And perhaps your Friend, the Janſeniſt, in whoſe vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication you write, will be as glad to ſee your Letter, which is much according to his palate, full of falſity and errours.</p>
               <p>You undertake to ſhew, that he hath not wronged <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> nor <hi>Valentia,</hi> nor <hi>Tanner:</hi> Let's ſee how you perform it. And to proceed orderly, let's begin with <hi>Vaſquez;</hi> and firſt lay down the accuſations on both ſides, and then come to you.</p>
               <p>The Authour then of the Provinciall Letters ſpeaketh thus in his Sixth Letter. <hi>It is ſaid in the Goſpel,</hi> Give Alms of your ſuperfluity<hi>: and yet divers Caſuiſts have found out a way, to exempt even the richeſt perſons from this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of giving Alms,—by interpreting the word</hi> ſuperfluity: <hi>inſomuch that it ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happeneth, that any man is troubled with any ſuch thing. And this is done by the learned</hi> Vaſquez <hi>in this manner. What ever men lay up out of a deſign to raiſe their fortunes, or thoſe of their relation, is not called</hi> ſuperfluous. <hi>For which reaſon it will be hard to finde any, among thoſe that are worldly minded, that have ought</hi> ſuperfluous; <hi>no not even among Kings.</hi> And a little after he concludeth, <hi>That it will be as ſure a way (according to</hi> Vaſquez) <hi>for a man that deſires</hi> to work his Salvation, <hi>to be guilty of</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:96350:148"/>
                  <hi>ambition enough, that ſo he may have nothing ſuperfluous, as it is (according to the Goſpel) not to be ambitious at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this the Jeſuites anſwered, That <hi>Vaſquez</hi> taught quite contrary to what the Janſeniſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him. Here was then the queſtion to be decided in the Twelfth Letter, and in its Anſwer, <hi>viz. Whether the Authour of the Provinciall Letters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ad cited</hi> Vaſquez <hi>right, or no?</hi> And you, Sir, who undertake to ſecond the Janſeniſt, Authour of the Provinciall Letters, maintain, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> is not wronged, but that he is really Authour of the Doctrine, for which he is cited. I undertake to prove the contrary. Our queſtion muſt be cleared by looking into <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> as he lieth, in that <hi>Treatiſe of Alms;</hi> which conſiſteth of four Chapters. Of theſe four the firſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is that, where he treateth the queſtion in hand, concerning Alms which ſecular men are bound to give.

               <p>You ſee here, that <hi>Gabriel, Alexander, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, Gerſon,</hi> clearly free ſecular men (as <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> alſo doth) from <hi>obligation of Precept</hi> of giving Alms in all caſes, but onely that of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neceſſity.

Yet <hi>Vaſquez</hi> hath the knack of complying with rich men, though he tell them, there be many other caſes which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them under Mortall Sin.

               <p>You thought that after you had made your Reply, no body would ever look into <hi>Vaſquez:</hi> for you could not think, but that if any body would take the pains to read <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> he ſhould finde his Doctrine as far from being lax and

He taketh the words; which make up his objection out of the Fourth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, num. 14. where <hi>Vaſquez</hi> treateth of the obligation, which Clergy-men have to give alms. If he had taken them out of the Firſt Chapter, he would there have found the Concluſions, which I have drawn out of him, in his own words. In the Fourth Chapter, num. 14. <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> ſaith nothing of the obligation which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men have, or have not, to give Alms: He treateth of the obligation of Clergy-men, and ſaith, That there is great difference betwixt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and Clergy-men; for Secular Men may lay up to encreaſe their ſtate; but Clergy-men may not. So in Secular Men, even Kings, you will hardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now if your Friend would needs quote theſe words out of the Fourth Chapter, to ſet down the obligation, which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Vaſquez)</hi> Secular men have to give Alms, at leaſt he ſhould have looked, how <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> qualified that obligation, in the place where he treated of Secular Men. By not doing this he fell to charge <hi>Vaſquez</hi> wrongfully of favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ambition, and relaxing the obligation which Secular Men have to give Alms.

                  </gap>s with terms, ſince your errour proceedeth from ignorance in terms, and from not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>urgent</hi> neceſſity. <hi>Ordinary</hi> neceſſity is that which Caſuiſts call, <hi>communis neceſſitas pauperum,</hi> the common neceſſity of all thoſe that are <hi>truly poor: urgent</hi> neceſſity is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96350:153"/>
that, which maketh poor men ſtand in preſent need of ſomething, neceſſary either for life, as Beggars do, (I mean <hi>true Beggars,</hi> that know not well where to have a meals meat) or for health, as ſick that are in want, or for preſerving their fame or goods, as thoſe that are oppreſſed by the rich, do. Theſe and many other ſuch like caſes are <hi>urgent;</hi> in which <hi>Vaſquez</hi> obligeth rich men under mortall ſin to afford their help, if they know that others will not do it. Now theſe caſes, which happen but too often, make it clear, that you wrong <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> in ſaying, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth not to give alms, but in very rare caſes, and ſuch as never happen in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I go on to ſhew you another errour of yours. The Jeſuite (for he was a Jeſuit, though you will needs miſtake him) had in his Anſwer to the Janſeniſts Twelfth Letter, urged the Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt to ſhew, out of what words of <hi>Vaſquez</hi> he could conclude, <hi>That it would be as ſafe (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to</hi> Vaſquez) <hi>for a man that deſireth his ſalvation, to be guilty of ambition enough, that ſo he may have nothing ſuperfluous, as it is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel, not to be ambitious at all.</hi> To this the Janſeniſt was mute; you give two Anſwers, but both ſuch as would make a Dog laugh. Firſt you ſay, <hi>You might anſwer, that this objection was never made by the Jeſuite in the Impoſture.</hi> Pretty, Pretty. Do you take your Friend to be excuſed from falſifying an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, if a Jeſuite do not pull him by the ſleeve, and ſay, <hi>Here, Sir, you have falſified this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour?</hi> Ridiculous. Is a lie no lie, unleſſe a man be challenged with it? Or a Theft no
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96350:153"/>
Theft, unleſſe a man be caught in it? <hi>John D' Alba</hi> will thank you for this Maxime, which makes his ſtealing more excuſable, then the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites <hi>Morall.</hi> But, Sir, your Friend was told of this. He was told, that he had diſguized <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> and corrupted his Doctrine; which he had done as well in theſe words, as in the reſt. He was challenged of all; but becauſe all his words were not cited at length, you tell us, <hi>You might anſwer that this objection was never made.</hi> Indeed you are a luſty Diſputant, that can talk ſo ſtoutly againſt reaſon. But I would pardon this frivolous anſwer, becauſe at leaſt it is ſhort; if you did not ſecond it with a tedious diſcourſe of Non-ſenſe, which makes your ſecond anſwer. The Summe is, That you will needs have it a ſin of Ambition for a ſecular man to lay up any thing for to raiſe himſelf, or his, though to ſuch a ſtate, as he may lawfully pretend; which <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> requireth, <hi>Statum, quem licitè poſſunt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirere.</hi> You are extreamly out, Sir, in your judgement: Will you ſay, That it is a ſin of Ambition, that is, of its own nature a Deadly Sin, for a Peaſant to lay up a little money, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may bring up his Childe at School, and make him a Lawyer, or a Phyſician, or (if God ſo call him) a Clergy-man? Or would you tell a Tradeſman, that he is bound ſtill to work in his ſhop, and that it is a ſin of Ambition to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo, that by laying up ſomething in his youth, he may live in a better calling in his old dayes? I am very glad, Sir, that you cannot impugn <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> his Doctrine, nor make it appear ill, but by advancing ſuch Paradoxes as theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:96350:154"/>
There remain yet two Objections more againſt <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> which I will take notice of: you would prove by them both, that at leaſt <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> obligeth rich men but very rarely to give alms. But what if you ſhould prove this? Have I not ſhewed you, that <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and divers others oblige onely in caſe of <hi>extream</hi> neceſſity, which is but rare? But let's hear you. <hi>Vaſquez</hi> (ſay you) underſtandeth all that he ſaith of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e duty of rich men to give alms, to oblige onely, <hi>when they know, that no body elſe will relieve the poor man.</hi> He ſaith ſo: I have put it in his ſeventh conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But is he therefore larger then others? <hi>Cajetan</hi> (as I have told you) holdeth, That I am not bound to give alms, but when I ſee a man in <hi>extream</hi> neceſſity. Now I can never know, that a man is in <hi>extream</hi> neceſſity of my alms, unleſſe I know, that no body elſe will relieve him. Yet this <hi>Cajetan</hi> requireth; and it will be a harder matter to oblige a man in <hi>Paris</hi> to give alms, out of <hi>Cajetans</hi> Doctrine, then out of <hi>Vaſquez</hi> his Doctrine. For <hi>Cajetan</hi> will ſay, That to oblige you under Mortall Sin to give this man an alms, you muſt know, that this man ſtandeth in <hi>extream</hi> need of your alms: <hi>Vaſquez</hi> will ſay, that to oblige you to give this man an alms, you muſt know, that this man is either in <hi>extream</hi> need of your alms, or in <hi>urgent</hi> need of it: Now <hi>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> need is a great deal more common, then <hi>extream</hi> need as is evident.</p>
               <p>But now I come to your grand <hi>Achilles,</hi> by which you would make it peremptorily certain, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> is very indulgent to the rich, and obligeth them very ſeldom to give alms; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:96350:154"/>
(ſay you) <hi>in thoſe caſes, in which</hi> Vaſquez <hi>obligeth rich men to give alms, he alloweth the poor to ſteal from them.</hi> For to anſwer this, I will do, as I did in the former matter, firſt ſet down <hi>Vaſquez</hi> his Doctrine, which <hi>in cap.</hi> 1. <hi>dub.</hi> 7. is delivered in two Concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, he ſaith with all Caſuiſts generally, That</hi> in extream neceſſity <hi>a poor man may take from the rich man that which is preciſely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his relief. The reaſon is, becauſe the rich man is ſuppoſed not to be rationally unwilling, that the poor man ſhould take to ſave his life that which is neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Vaſquez</hi> ſaith further <hi>That in ſome</hi> urgent neceſſity <hi>a poor man may take from a rich man.</hi> He ſaith <hi>in ſome caſe (aliquo caſu)</hi> for it is not generall: and he explica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>eo (inquam) caſu, quo alius tenebatur h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ic, patienti extremam neceſſitatem vel gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem, ſuccurrere.—</hi>In that caſe, in which the rich man was bound to ſuccour this poor man. In this Concluſion <hi>Vaſquez</hi> is againſt <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and the Major part of Divines; but he hath with him <hi>Sylveſter</hi> and <hi>Angelus.</hi> The reaſon of this Concluſion is the ſame, as of the former: For I cannot rationally be unwilling, that the poor man ſhould take that, which I was bound under Mortal Sin to give him. This is <hi>Vaſquez</hi> his Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Now that which I have to ſay here is firſt, that this very Doctrine of <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> which you lay hold on, evidently convinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> is ſtricter in point of obliging rich men to give alms, then <hi>Cajetan,</hi> or other Divines ordinarily
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96350:155"/>
are. For <hi>Vaſquez</hi> therefore granteth, that the poor may take from the rich that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely neceſſary, in more caſes then <hi>Cajetan</hi> and others do, becauſe he holdeth the rich obliged to give alms in more caſes, then <hi>Cajetan</hi> and others do. So that the firſt thing, that can be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from this objection, is, that you and your Friend have all the way falſified <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> and wrongfully judged him to be indulgent to the rich.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I have to ſay concerneth your Illation, <hi>That either</hi> Vaſquez <hi>doth not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily oblige rich men to give Alms, or elſe he giveth the poor an ordinary permiſſion to ſteal.</hi> I muſt tell you, this Illation is very illogicall and inconſequent. It is very true, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> doth not ordinarily, that is, upon ordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, oblige rich men <hi>by precept</hi> to give alms; for he requireth, that the caſe be <hi>urgent</hi> at leaſt, which is not <hi>ordinary;</hi> and ſo your whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment faileth in the firſt clauſe. Yet upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account it faileth worſe in the ſecond clauſe. For <hi>Vaſquez</hi> doth not ſay, That in all caſes of <hi>urgent neceſſity</hi> the poor may ſteal; no, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that: but (as I have told you) he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that when this particular rich man is bound to relieve this particular poor man, then the poor man may take to ſupply his neceſſity. Now this is not ordinary. And it is made leſſe ordinary, and conſequently the poor mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſteal leſſe frequent, by that clauſe, which <hi>Vaſquez</hi> prudently put, <hi>That this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate rich man is not bound under precept, to give this poor man an Alms, unleſſe he proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:96350:155"/>
                  <hi>ſuppoſe, that no body elſe will, or can do it.</hi> This caution you very ſimply laughed at, though it be a neceſſary one, and ſheweth, that the poor man, if he be refuſed by one rich man, ought to go to another, and not preſently fall a pilfering. But if after all his induſtry in begging no body will help him, then according to <hi>Vaſquez</hi> he may lawfully take that which is neceſſary for his relief, not onely in his <hi>extream,</hi> but alſo in his <hi>urgent</hi> want.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>Vaſquez</hi> his Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ine; which if you will impugn with reaſon, I ſhall willingly hear you: for I am not of <hi>Vaſquez</hi> his opinion, nor of <hi>Caj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor were it any great credit for you, if in a Work, which the Authour never lived to perfect, you ſhould ſpy ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing Simony, which is crime enough, if you can prove it.</p>
               <p>But before I begin with you, I will ſet down ſomething for a generall Notion of Simony, to clear the Reader, and let him know in what all agree, and what the terms, which we muſt uſe, do mean. For though you, Sir, and your Friend, would needs be anſwered in this matter without School-terms, yet I judge it very impertinent to humour you in this deſire: and if every Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96350:156"/>
is allowed his terms; if a Faulconer or Huntſ-man would be laughed at for relating their Game without the terms of their art, ſure it cannot be required, that a Divine ſhould deſert his terms, which are neceſſary to make him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the Reader will be pleaſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the Definition of Simony, which St. <hi>Tho.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 100. and all Divines allow of, is that which is given in <hi>Gloſſ. Decret. c.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 1. in theſe words. <hi>Simonia eſt ſtudioſa voluntas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendi aut vendendi aliquid ſpirituale, aut ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituali annexum.</hi> 
                  <q>Simony is a deliberate will of Buying, or Selling, ſome Spirituall Thing, or ſomething annexed to a Spirituall Thing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the Authour, from whoſe infamous crime this horrid Sin hath its name, is <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus;</hi> who would have bought of St. <hi>Peter</hi> the power of giving the Holy Ghoſt by Impoſition of hands. For though the Authour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Letters (a fit Advocate for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) ſay, (Letter the Twelfth, page 294. firſt Edit.) <hi>That it is certain that</hi> Simon Magus <hi>uſed no terms of Buying or Selling,</hi> yet it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he did; and upon the authority of Scripture we have it, that he would have <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>bought that power of</hi> St. Peter. So St. <hi>Peter</hi> underſtood it, and ſo all the world conceived it, till this Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt was pleaſed to plead for <hi>Simon Magus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly all conſent, that according to the Definition given, to make any act truly Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacall, there muſt be a Buying or Selling of ſome Spirituall Thing, or ſomething annexed to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96350:156"/>
a Spirituall Thing: And if there be not a Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Selling, then all agree, that there is no Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. By this means Curats, and other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are exempt from Simony. For though they receive Tythes, Penſions, Stipends, and Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions from the people in reſpect of their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Functions, yet they receive them not <hi>as a price</hi> of their Spiritual Functions, but as a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Subſiſtance, which out of gratitude (or to incline them to do willingly what they undertake) the people pay, or give thoſe, by whom they are helped in Spiritualls: and this is grounded on Chriſts appointment. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>So our Lord ordained, to them that announce the Goſpell, to live of the Goſpell.</hi> It is therefore allowed by all, that it is not Simony (ſpeaking onely according to the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>finition) to give a Temporall Good for a Spirituall, either by way of gratitude, or to encline the will, when there is no pact, or bargain of Juſtice interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And by this Doctrine many acts, which are commended by Antiquity, are underſtood. For example, <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Hiſtory, Anno 929. commendeth <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Germany,</hi> (whom he calleth <hi>the Ornament of Chriſtian Religion)</hi> for having given great gifts, and a great part of the Province of <hi>Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>via</hi> to <hi>Rodulph</hi> King of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> for to obtain of him the Lance of <hi>Conſtanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> in which there was one of the Nails, wherewith Chriſt was nailed to the Croſſe. This act is commended by <hi>Baronius;</hi> who would never have commended Simony. Nor indeed can that good King be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Simony; ſince God bleſſed him, as <hi>Luit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prandus</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:96350:157"/>
relateth, with a great victory by means of that Lance. And beſides he made a vow to God to extirpate Simony in all his Realm. We muſt therefore ſay, that what he gave for the Lance, which he eſteemed <hi>Sacred,</hi> was not <hi>as a price</hi> to buy it, but <hi>as a motive</hi> to induce King <hi>Rodulph</hi> to give it, or <hi>a gratitude</hi> for it. And the like we muſt judge of divers other ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, commended by Antiquity, and practiſed by Saints.</p>
               <p>Fourthly it is to be known, that among other Diviſions of Simony one very common is into Simony againſt <hi>the Divine Law,</hi> and Simony <hi>againſt Poſitive Law.</hi> Simony <hi>againſt Divine Law</hi> is that, which properly and ſtrictly agreeth with the Definition above mentioned: Simony <hi>againſt Poſitive Law,</hi> as <hi>Sotus</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de Juſtit. q.</hi> 5. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. is not properly Simony; for it hath not in it a Buying, or Selling, of a Spiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Thing, or any thing annexed to a Spirituall Thing. But it is called Analogically Simony, becauſe it is puniſhed by the Church as Simony. For the Church hath forbidden many acts under pain of Simony, for very juſt reaſons, though thoſe acts contain not a Buying or Selling of a Spirituall Thing. Theſe acts are all expreſſed in the Eccleſiaſticall, or <hi>Poſitive Law.</hi> So that to incurre Simony againſt <hi>Poſitive Law,</hi> is to do ſome act expreſly forbidden in the <hi>Poſitive Law</hi> under pain of Simony. Theſe acts are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and it imports not to ſet them down: we have ſaid enough for our purpoſe.</p>

On the one ſide, by citing the page he would have all the world believe, he was very exact; and on the other ſide, by not telling what Impreſſion he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, he was ſure, no man ſhould finde it out. There have been ſeverall Impreſſions of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and in my Book, which was printed at <hi>Ingol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtad,</hi>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. there is no ſuch thing in the page cited. I was troubled at this; but being reſolved to ſearch further, and to finde it out at laſt, I went to the Twelfth Letter, where the the ſame matter is handled again. There I found, that the citation of the page 2042. was meant of the page 2044. and that it was in <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 3. I turned therefore for the ſixteenth Diſputation, hoping there to finde both what was in the Sixth and Twelfth Letter. But the jeſt on't was, that in that Tome there are but Ten diſputations: So that your Friends citing the Sixteenth, was but to fool the world, or rather to declare himſelf a Knave to all the world. I ſuppoſe you will lay the fault on the Printer; but I believe the Sequell will ſhew where the fault was. For I being ſtill unſatisfied, went, and read all the Treatiſe of <hi>Valentia</hi> concerning Simony; which is in his Third Tome, Diſp. 6. and in the Sixteenth Queſtion: and after all I muſt tell you, that there is no ſuch thing in <hi>Valentia,</hi> as either the Sixth or Twelfth Letter impoſe on him. There are indeed p. 3. (and in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion named pag. 1983. lit. D.) ſome words, which make it clear, that this is the place which was meant by thoſe citations; as for example the Latine words, which he citeth in the Twelfth Letter (for thoſe in the Sixth are of his own coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) are there, though not fully as they are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But as to the whole matter, he hath falſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Tanner,</hi> your Friend ſaith thus. <hi>Tanner is of the ſame opinion with</hi> Valentia, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 1519. <hi>confeſſing withall, that St.</hi> Thomas <hi>is of a contrary opinion, in that he abſolutely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>

                  <hi>that it is undeniable Simony to give a Spirituall Good for a Temporall, if the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall be the end thereof.</hi> Here <hi>Tanner</hi> is accuſed firſt, of all that which <hi>Valentia</hi> is accuſed of in the ſixth Letter, though he have not the words imputed to him, nor the ſenſe of them, no more then <hi>Valentia;</hi> and next of ſpeaking againſt the abſolute authority of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this the Jeſuite charged your Friend with Impoſture; and he endeavoured to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Twelfth Letter: But the Anſwer to that Letter made him ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll appear an Impoſtour, ſo clearly that I need not adde one word. After all you come, Sir, to maintain the Impoſtour: but your Diſcourſe is ſo childiſh, and ſo manifeſtly againſt reaſon, that a young Logician, newly ſtept over <hi>pons aſinorum,</hi> would be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it all. Your words run thus.</p>
               <p>Tanner <hi>ſaith in general, that it is no Simony in point of Conſcience</hi> (in foro conſcientiae) <hi>to give a ſpiritual good for a Temporal, when the Temporal is only the Motive, though the principal one, and not the price of the Spiritual. And when he ſaith, it is not Simony in point of Conſcience, his meaning is, that it is not any, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ither in regard of Divine right, or of Poſitive right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, Sir, you falſifie <hi>Tanner,</hi> in telling us <hi>he ſpeaketh in general</hi> of Simony. He doth not in that place ſpeak <hi>in general</hi> of Simony; he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely of Simony againſt <hi>Divine Right,</hi> as is manifeſt; firſt by the words which he uſeth, <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rè &amp; propriè Simonia,</hi> truly and properly Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which import Simony againſt <hi>Divine Right.</hi> And ſecondly by his expreſſe <hi>Caveat,</hi> which he
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:96350:159"/>
immediately giveth, as the Jeſuite hath already told you. Again, Sir, you are highly out in the terms, when you take Simony <hi>in foro conſcientiae</hi> (in the Court of Conſcience) to be a Generical name, according to <hi>Tanner,</hi> to all Simony; which is evidently falſe. For when <hi>Tanner</hi> had ſaid, <hi>That it is not Simony in the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> he preſently adjoyneth, <hi>That this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth not, but that it may be Simony of Poſitive Right:</hi> which is the exteriour Court. So he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Simony <hi>in foro conſcientiae</hi> to Simony <hi>in foro exteriori:</hi> by the firſt he underſtands Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt <hi>Divine Law:</hi> by the other Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt <hi>Poſitive Law.</hi> Nor in this is he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; but uſeth the terms, as other Divines do. Therefore when he ſaith, it is not Simony <hi>in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro conſcientiae,</hi> in the interiour Court of the Conſcience, his meaning is not to ſay, that it is not Simony <hi>in point of Conſcience,</hi> but it is not Simony againſt <hi>Divine Right;</hi> which is juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what you inferre.</p>
               <p>You go on therefore, and ſay, <hi>Simony of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Right is Simony in point of Conſcience.</hi> I anſwer, that it is very certain, that he that bath committed Simony againſt <hi>Poſitive Right,</hi> is guilty in his conſcience of Simony. <hi>Tanner,</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> and every body ſay ſo. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m <hi>in foro conſcientiae</hi> (in the Court of Conſcience) is very different from that other term, <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> (in the exteriour Court) where Poſitive Law is pronounced, as every Divine can tell you.</p>
               <p>Now (to omit ſome of your Non-ſenſe) I come to the conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quence which you draw from
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96350:160"/>
this; which is, <hi>Conſequently there are ſome Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things which a man may, without Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony according to Poſitive Right, give for Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall goods, by changing the word Price into that of Motive.</hi> I anſwer firſt, That your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence followeth not out of your Antecedent; and ſo you erre groſly in Logick. Secondly I anſwer, That no conſequence can make, that the change of words ſhall ſave committing Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Thirdly I anſwer, That if you will frame your Propoſition right, and ſay, <hi>That there are ſome Spirituall Things, which a man may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Simony againſt either Divine or Poſitive Right, give or do for Temporall goods, not as for a price, but as for a Motive,</hi> I grant it. This <hi>Tanner,</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and all generally ſay: So you may give your Curate his Fee for Baptizing your Childe; not as <hi>a price</hi> of that Sacrament, but as a <hi>gratitude,</hi> or <hi>ſtipend,</hi> which inclines the Curate willingly to do his Function. So I may give a poor man an Alms to move him to pray for me, or (if he be a Prieſt) to ſay a Maſſe for me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and there's no Simony, though you are ſo ſimple as not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. So alſo all the Tythes, Stipends, Diſtributions, and Fees, that are given to Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men, are given, not as <hi>the price</hi> of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Functions, or adminiſtring Sacraments, but as a <hi>Motive,</hi> or as a <hi>Gratuity,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> told you, already: and every body knows, that the people neither give their Goods to Church-men for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor are Simoniacall for paying their Duties.</p>
               <p>And ſo, Sir, you are extreamly out in <hi>Tanner,</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:96350:160"/>
as well as in <hi>Valentia</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez. Tanner</hi> teacheth not the Doctrine, with which you charge him: nor is he ſo much againſt St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> as you would have him. He taketh the opinion, which ſeemeth to be againſt St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> but which is conſonant to St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Definition of Simony <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and in this he followeth <hi>Sotus</hi> a Dominican, who explicateth St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> And if you mark it, Sir, you need not have run to falſifie either <hi>Valentia</hi> or <hi>Tanner,</hi> for to have drawn the Argument, which you and your Friend make. If you had not had a minde to butt againſt ſome Jeſuite, you might have made a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Syllogiſme out of the Definition of Simony, which St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and all the Schools hold. For example, you might have ſaid thus. According to the Definition which all allow, Simony is a Buying, or Selling, ſome Spirituall Thing, or ſomething that is annexed to a Spirituall Thing. But where a Temporall Thing is given freely, and is not <hi>a price,</hi> but onely a gratuit gift, or a <hi>motive</hi> inclining the will, there is no Buying or Selling a Spirituall Thing, or any thing annexed to a Spirituall Thing; therefore where a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Thing is given freely, and is not <hi>a price,</hi> but a gratuit gift, or <hi>a motive</hi> inclining the will, there is no Simony. Thus you might have argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well out of the Definition, which St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and all allow, as out of <hi>Tanner,</hi> or <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> or any Jeſuite. Apply this to your caſe of a Living of four hundred pound a year, parted with for a thouſand pound in hand, or any which ſhock the commands of the Church; and I defie you to anſwer without uſing the diſtinction <hi>of</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:96350:161"/>
                  <hi>Divine Right, and Poſitive Right,</hi> which the Jeſuites uſe, and all Divines ſince St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his time, and long before.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, I have done. For all the reſt that you ſay, of <hi>Eradus Billus, Sanchez,</hi> and who you will elſe, is nothing to the purpoſe. That which you undertook was to ſhew, that <hi>Vaſquez, Valentia,</hi> and <hi>Tanner</hi> did teach, that which was imputed to them by the Authour of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Letters.

               <p>In good earneſt, Sir, you ought not to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſecret of thoſe good Fathers to the whole world. For beſides that you give a jealouſie to all Divines, by theſe rare commendations which they deſerve as well as the Jeſuites, ſeeing they teach the ſame Doctrine; you furniſh Theeves and Murtherers with a pregnant argument, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves from the Judges, and ſtrangely ſubvert the order of juſtice: for when by the ſubtlety of this diſtinction, they have ſhewn the Judges, that 'tis lawfull to rob and kill <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> they will finde a way to paſſe (as you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably prove it) <hi>from the ſpeculation to the practice.</hi> And why ſhould not they have right to act, what the Schools teach? However I am confident, there are not many, that would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly truſt to that ſecret of theſe Doctours, but would rather prefer that of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> who had found a method, how to take ſecretly as much of the money belonging to the Colledge of Saint <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> as would maintain <hi>Barcos without any mans diſcovering it by the yearly accounts he was to make thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold how oppoſite the Maximes of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> are to thoſe of the <hi>Janſeniſts.</hi> The Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, ſay you, approve of crimes in ſpeculation, and condemn them in practice: The Janſeniſts commit crimes in practice, and condemn them in ſpeculation. The Jeſuites, according to your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96350:169"/>
ſeek diſtinctions to ſecure themſelves againſt Judges: and the Ianſeniſts invent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies to ſecure themſelves againſt the Popes. <hi>But which is much reſented by thoſe who have a reall love for that reformed Church, whoſe re-eſtabliſhment you project,</hi> the Ieſuites for the zeal they bear to the good of the State, are welcome to the Iudges: whereas the Ianſeniſts, by reaſon of their rebellion againſt the Church, finde no favour from the Popes.</p>
               <p>Behold the true Source of all your calumnies and reproaches. This it is, that makes you fret with envy, and which begets this third obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>That the Jeſuites imagine, that the eſteem they have in the Church, will hinder men from puniſhing their attempts againſt the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you not fear they will be ſtung at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and offended, that you publiſh the credit they have in the Church? Had all the Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sect laboured as long a time to juſtifie the ſound Doctrine of the Ieſuites, as it hath done to calumniate it, could it have ſuggeſted to you a more pregnant, clear, and invincible proof then this? For if they have credit in the Church, which is holy and wiſe; on what elſe can it be grounded, but on the purity of their manners and doctrine? Can vice have eſteem, where ſanctity reigns? Or unſound Doctrine ſubſiſt with honour, where verity Preſides?</p>
               <p>Recall to minde what you practis'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> with Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth, and the arts you us'd to purchaſe credit in the Church. Have you prevail'd therein? Have you by all your Intrigues procur'd approbation of any one
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96350:170"/>
of your pernicious Maximes? The very name of Ianſeniſt, is it not equally ſuſpected of Church and State? Have not all your Books been bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by an opprob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And have they not lately condemn'd at <hi>Rome</hi> the two laſt Letters of <hi>Monſieur Arnauld,</hi> which made ſo great a noiſe in <hi>Sorbon?</hi> Who ſees not this diſgrace to be an infallible ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now therefore argue thus by the Law of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. <hi>The Jeſuites have reputation in the Church.</hi> Councels approve their Inſtitute; Popes make Bulls in favour of their ſound Doctrine, and good life: The Biſhops honout them with employment in their Dioceſſes, to labour for the ſalvation of ſouls, and inſtruction of the people. The good and vertuous, that know them, love them; there are none but Heretiques and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, that perſecute them. Men muſt therefore conclude, that the Ianſeniſts are much to blame for decrying their Morality, ſince it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally approv'd, that thoſe ſcandalous Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which fly over all <hi>France,</hi> are fill'd with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Impoſtures, Falſhoods, and Diſguiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>There are ſome that contradict common ſenſe, which we call Extravagant and temerarious, as that of the ſame Abbot, who proves in his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all queſtion,</hi> which you acknowledge for the firſt of his works, that men are oftentimes oblig'd to kill themſelves; and that as this obligation is one of the moſt important and difficult, ſo there is required a great courage, and an extraordinary ſtrength of minde to perform it.</p>
               <p>There be other opinions that are receiv'd by the whole Church, from which it is not lawfull to recede, and which for that reaſon we term Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, Catholique, Indubitable. For inſtance, that he who kills a Thief, whom he findes in the night forcing the doors of a houſe; or breaking through the walls, ought not to be queſtioned for it; for the Scripture it ſelf declares as much.</p>
               <p>There be yet other opinions, that are not ſo clear and evident, which the Church leaves to be diſputed by Divines, permiting them to hold what they think good; and theſe are they we call <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable:</hi> among which we muſt yet diſtinguiſh

               <p>You ſee the reaſon why Divines affirm them probable in <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> but not in <hi>practice.</hi> And if ſome few, as you have obſerv'd, teach that all things, which are lawfull in ſpeculation, are alſo allowable in practice, 'tis not in that ill ſenſe you aſcribe unto them: but in another clean contrary.

                  <hi>if the Prince, or a Sovereign Court, ſhould forbid it by their Declarations, or Ordinances, then the opinion that ſhould be found contrary, would ceaſe to be probable.

Wherefore when it is ſaid, that an opinion is not probable in practice, I hold, for my part, that it is not probable in ſpeculation neither, becauſe the inconveniences, that occurre in the practice, ſhew us the falſhood of it.</hi>

               <p>Now, Sir, I pray does not <hi>F. Eſcobar</hi> reaſon well ſometimes? Had you argued ſo well as he, ſhould you not have paſſed from the Practice to the Speculation, inſtead of paſſing, as you do, from the Speculation to the Practice?

                     </gap>ience.</hi> You take the words of Authours meerly to corrupt them. When it is ſaid that one celebrious Authour is ſufficient to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96350:172"/>
make an opinion probable and ſafe in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 'tis not to be underſtood, that all he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es is probable. You are as far from the ſenſe of this Propoſition, as Heaven if from Earth. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Cajetan</hi> is a famous Authour; and yet, by a ſupream order, they have cut oft from his writings divers deciſions that were not maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The true ſenſe of this <hi>Maxime,</hi> Sir, is, that the probability of an opinion depends not ſo much on the multitude of Authours that teach it, as on the ſtrength of the reaſons whereon it is grounded. For were there but one ſole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour that aſſerted it, yet in caſe the reaſons he brought were ſolid, and the opinion he eſtabliſht neither repugnant to Faith, nor good manners, his authority were ſufficient to introduce it into the Schools, and to give it credit among the Learned. See what it is that has deceiv'd you. You ſeparated the authority of the Authour from the force of his reaſons, conformable to Faith and good manners: and 'tis no wonder, if from a Maxime corrupted by ignorance, or diſguis'd by artifice, you have deduc'd no better conſequences.</p>
               <p>It is conſequently falſe, Sir, that the Doctrine of Probability makes the Jeſuits the maintainers of all the errours the Caſuiſts can commit; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to the contrary, Probability excludes the errors that are repugnant to the rules of Faith, and diſcipline of good manners.</p>
               <p>It is falſe, that this diverſity of probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is fatall to Religion. This ſmells of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſme: nor can you averre ſuch a falſhood, without offending the Pope, who permits them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:96350:173"/>
the Univerſities, which teach them; and all wiſe men, who follow them.</p>
               <p>It is falſe, that this very diverſity of opinions, provided they be probable, is contrary to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and his Order; ſince it is not contrary to the ſpirit of the Church. When he recommends to them uniformity of minde and doctrine, he takes not from them the liberty of probable opinions, but ſeverely forbids them to embrace hereticall and dangerous opinions: and were there any one among his Children, that had embraced <hi>Janſeniſme,</hi> their Order could no more endure him, then the ſea can endure a dead body, without thruſting it from its boſome, and caſting it on the ſand.</p>
               <p>It is falſe in fine, that the doctrine of probable opinions, is a mark of their remiſneſſe. And when you ſay, <hi>That there are many other Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts that are grown remiſſe as well as they,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with them they maintain probable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; you do them more honour then you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.

               <p>What will you ſay, Sir, if I ſhew you, that though you are a declar'd enemy to the Doctrine of Probable Opinions, yet you are oblig'd in deſpite of your averſion, to approve what you condemn, and to bear at the ſame time two ſo different Titles, as Accuſer of what you

approve, and Approver of what you accuſe?</p>
               <p>For either you believe, that among the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Morality there are Opinions Probable on either part, or you do not believe it: if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, you are an adherent to Probability: if you disbelieve it, you go againſt common ſenſe. For if it be true, as the Philoſopher ſayes, That in no Science there is more of Probability, and leſſe of evidence then in Morality, is it not abſurd to expect to finde in it what is not there? I ſhould as eaſily ſay, you have found the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth, and falſhood of all things, and that in caſe we hearken to <hi>Port Royall,</hi> we ſhall have nothing but Articles of Faith in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Divinity, Canons and indubitable Rules in Morality, infallible Aphoriſmes in Phyſick, Demonſtrations in Phyloſophy, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of Right and Fact clearer then the Sun in the ſcience of the Laws, and that you will baniſh out of the world all Probability, which in your judgement, is the Source of all Irregularities. Pardon me, if I tell you, it is more then probable, that you either deceive the world, or your ſelf, if you be in that errour.</p>
               <p>Moreover preſuppoſing that you muſt needs paſſe for ridiculous, unleſſe you admit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Opinions in Morality, either you hold that of two Probable Opinions, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes follow the ſecureſt; or you hold it not<hi>:</hi> If you judge that men are not alwayes bound to prefer the ſafeſt, you approve what you have condemned.

Death is not to be fear'd by a juſt man: let an enemy aſſault him, he can do him no conſiderable hurt: he fears nothing but the loſſe of God: and ſo far is death from doing him that prejudice, that on the contrary it gives him the fruition of God. But if he kill that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Aggreſſor, he does him an irreparable evil: he prefers a brittle life which is but a blaſt, before the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which is of an infinite value: and inſtead of dying with honour to ſave the ſoul of his brother, he hazards even his own by deſtroying anothers.

When Caſuiſts affirm it lawful to kill in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of goods and honour, to whom do they grant this right? to the good and innocent; to thoſe very people, to whom you grant it for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of life and Chaſtity. There is then no fear of their abuſing it; or if there be any danger, 'tis on both ſides equal. Againſt whom do they grant it? againſt men that live by their own Crimes, and ſubſiſt by other mens misfortunes. Nor do they allow it, but in caſe of extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, when there's no other refuge; when there's a queſtion of a notable loſs; when they cannot have recourſe to the juſtice of the Lawes; when they are in danger, not onely probable, but certain, evident, and indubitable of loſing either their Fortune or their Honour: I mean not the falſe honour which dazles your eyes; but that honour which the moſt wiſe and vertuous hold for ſuch.

What, Sir, is this the Janſenian humility, that ſo vaunts with oſtentation of having ſubmitted to the Vicar of Chriſt, while it rejects the narration of his Bull, and accuſes the Oracle of truth of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood &amp; lying? Is this the ſincerity where with you juſtiſie your Doctrine, by condemning thoſe of remerity who oppoſed it before it was condemn'd, and accuſing thoſe of calumny, who aſcribe it to you, ſince the publique voice of the Church hath blaſted it with an eternall ignominy? Before the Popes Bull the Hereſie of <hi>Janſenius</hi> appear'd with luſtre in your Works, it march'd with great attendance, and neverſhew'd it ſelf, but guarded with the Fathers of the firſt Ages: It was the Doctrine of the Church, the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, the Doctrine of the Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: After the Bull, this Hereſie is nothing but a <hi>Chim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ra,</hi> which every man fancies ſuch as he pleaſes, and no man knows in very truth. Before the Popes Bull, it was a crime to queſtion the Five Propoſitions, and they that held them ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, were <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> Enemies of the grace of Chriſt; ſuch as attempred to deſtroy the moſt ancient Verities, and to obſcure the cleareſt Lights of the Goſpel. After the Bull, it is an injury to impute them to you, and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach you with them are hainous <hi>Detracters,</hi> and <hi>moſt impudent Lyars.</hi> Before the Bull, thoſe Maximes were as ſo many unalterable Rules of Faith, where of Tradition was he Source, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Oracle, and <hi>Monſieur de Ipre</hi> the faithfull Interpreter that had renew'd them in our Age. After the Bull, thoſe very Maximes by a ſtrange <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> are become meer

               </p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, it appears that you have an ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith, which you explicate according to the time; a Faith that has two faces, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets illuſions in mens mindes: at this day it is a Chimera, becauſe you dare not produce it, ſo odious it is to all the world: when you have wip'd away the ſhame of it, and that the Cenſure is forgotten, it will again be the ſpirit of the firſt Ages. To grant; to deny; to ſay yes, to ſay no, are things indifterent to you: You put all in practice to advance the pretended reformation you promiſe, and that imaginary dominion which you affect in the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch. 'Tis onely the hatred you bear to the Jeſuites, that never changes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your bad inclination towards Religion ever continues. You look upon their zeal as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle that retards the progreſſe of your deſigns; and becauſe you cannot ſhake their vertue, you endeavour, at leaſt, to ruine the reputation it gains, and the approbation it deſerves. Hence it comes that you make them Authours of all your diſgraces, and not daring to complain of the hand that ſtrikes you, at every blow you feel you bite the hand that would heal you.</p>
               <p>If the Pope condemneth the works of <hi>Port-Royall;</hi> the Jeſuites preſently become Falſifiers, and Forgers of Bulls againſt the Doctrine of the Fathers. If he command the Marble of Janſenius's Tomb to be taken up, and that the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96350:195"/>
marks of that proud monument, which ſerv'd as a Trophy to Hereſie, be effaced; the Jeſuites are men of prophane ſpirits, they ſuffer Idolatry in <hi>China,</hi> they traffique in <hi>Canada,</hi> they favour Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines in <hi>Europe,</hi> and uphold remiſneſſe and diſorder in all parts of the world. If the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in <hi>France</hi> reprove the ſurreptitious <hi>Elogium</hi> of the Abbot of St. <hi>Cyran;</hi> the Jeſuites every where perſecute Perſons of Honour, and are ſo far from ſparing the living, that they forbear not even the memory of the dead. If <hi>Sorbon</hi> do juſtice on it ſelf, and couragiouſly cut off its own members, where they ſee inflamation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to be gather'd by the contagion of your errours; the Jeſuits (ſay you) are the Corrupters of Diſcipline, and it is neceſſary to extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them for the good of Souls, and Glory of God.</p>
               <p>What ever advantage they may have in the Doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> yet muſt they ſtill be attaqued in the point of <hi>Manners.</hi> Their Writers muſt all be racked, and nothing left intire in any of their Books: they muſt be falſified by infamous forgings; they muſt be altered by unfaithfull ſuppreſſions; a falſe aſpect muſt be given them by malignant interpretations; ſome paſſages of them muſt be ſhortned, others lengthened; thoſe muſt have that cut off which juſtifie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

you take upon you ſuch a wretched employment, and that after you have ſpoken ſo long, like Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the language of the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> you are now reduc'd, like Moaths, to eat the Books of the new Caſuiſts. But the wiſe are not the greater number: for one Perſon of Honour that will be afflicted at this diſorder, you will make a hundred Libertines laugh, who are ſo pleas'd with detractions of this nature, that even the falſe do often delight them more then the true. In fine the Jeſuites will not fail to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and make you bluſh at your gulleries. But you are ready to welcome them; if they preſſe you with the force of reaſon, you will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Truly, Sir, you are fallen upon a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious way of defending your ſelf, and aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others; ſince all your dexterity conſiſts in <hi>lying impudently,</hi> which is not hard to do; and in giving others the <hi>Lye</hi> with impunity, which is yet more eaſie; in aſperſing the Innocent with hideous Calumnies to make them criminall, and calling them Calumniators, to vindicate your ſelf of all your crimes.

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:96350:196"/>
what he had ſaid of him in the former. This is an apparent falſhood. For it is to be ſeen, that from the third page of his ſecond Book, he declares to the contrary, <hi>That men are much to blame to accuſe him of having call'd that Paſtour Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique; that there is no man of judgement, who examines the terms of his firſt Apology,</hi> (for he aſſaults not, but defends himſelf) <hi>but will judge this gloſſe too violent, and that complaint very tender.</hi> You are therefore an Impoſtour, and that a ſignall one.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:96350:196"/>
famous <hi>Baſilius Pontius,</hi> which is not rejected in the Schools. The ſecond ſenſe is, that one may temerariouſly expoſe himſelf to thoſe occaſions, and even formally ſeek them out upon light grounds. And this Doctrine the Abbot of <hi>Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic,</hi> who paſſes with you for <hi>F. Pinthereau,</hi> calls deteſtable. As to the firſt ſenſe, I accus'd you of ignorance, for making a crime of an opinion common in Divinity; and for the ſecond I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd you of malice, in regard there is not ſo much as the leaſt print, or foot-ſtop, thereof in <hi>F.

               <p>I affirm therefore, that the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and that without all diſpute, they ought to be call'd by that name. The reaſon is, for want of a due ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the Holy Sea, and the Declarations made by the Church to advertiſe, that the Doctrine they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is Hereticall. I will not ſpeak of the Bull of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. which affirms <hi>Janſenius</hi> to have <hi>reviv'd a Doctrine already condemn'd, to the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of Chriſtianity and contempt of the Sea Apoſtolique; and therefore condemns his Book anew.</hi> Every man knows, that both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flaunders</hi> they have publiſh'd a number of Books, to perſwade the nullity and falſhood of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96350:203"/>
that Bull. And if after all they will ſtill vaunt of their ſubmiſſion, a man muſt ſay, that to obey after the Janſeniſt faſhion, is to diſpute againſt the command.</p>
               <p>I onely ſpeak of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and maintain that they have not ſubmitted to it, nor hold the <hi>condemned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> for well and duly condemned; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration whereof is eaſie. For the Pope in condemning the Propoſitions did not condemn the characters they are written in, nor the voice they are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And that we might not be put to the trouble of divining that ſenſe, the Pope, who condemns the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, declares it to us in the ſame <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> when he calls them <hi>opinions of Janſenius;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by thoſe words, that he pretends to condemn the opinions of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> in condemning thoſe Propoſitions, and which comes all to one, that be intends to condemn thoſe Propoſitions in the ſenſe they have in <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s Doctrine. Since that Conſtitution, the Pope has made another Decree, by which he twice pronounced, that in the Five Propoſitions he condemned the Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius:</hi> Wherefore he proſcribes, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits afreſh the pretended <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> and all Books either written, or to be written, that ſhall defend his Doctrine. The Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> having explicated the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in the ſame manner, and affirmed that the Five Propoſitions were condemn'd <hi>in</hi>

                  <hi>the ſenſe of Janſenius;</hi> the Pope in avowing their explication rejoyced thereat, and has again the third time pronounced, that he condemn'd the Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius</hi> in the Five Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The aſſembly generall of the Clergy have receiv'd his Brief, and confirm'd it by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies they have given of their ſatisfaction therein.</p>
               <p>The manifeſt reſult of all which is, that 'tis not a ſubmitting to the Popes Conſtitutions, to ſay they condemn the Five Propoſitions; and yet approve the Opinions, Doctrine, or Senſe of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> Wherefore we ask the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> whether in condemning the Five Propoſitions, as they pretend to do, they condemn the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Senſe, and Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius?</hi> If they ſay yes; praiſed be God, that they return to the Churches <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Tis notoriouſly known, that the five Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at <hi>Rome,</hi> a few dayes before their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>proteſted</hi> before the Pope in the name of themſelves, and all the Diſciples and Defenders of St. <hi>Auguſtine, that they did, and would maintain, during their lives, the Five Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their legitimate ſenſe, as containing the undoubted Doctrine of St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of the Church.</hi> They well knew that in their opinion, the ſenſe of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Janſenius</hi> were not different.

               </p>
               <p>We are therefore agreed of the Fact, by the Janſeniſts own confeſſion; to wit, That the five Propoſitions are of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> either as to the words, or as to the ſenſe they may receive; nay, as to their <hi>legitimate ſenſe,</hi> if we will believe their Deputies at <hi>Rome.</hi> We muſt therefore hence forward diſpute onely of the Right, to know whether the Fact which we are agreed on deſerves approbation or condemnation.

they call it a ſubmiſſion to refuſe to act what is ordained.</p>
               <p>Nor can they alledge that <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s <hi>own ſenſe</hi> of the Propoſitions, and that which <hi>we pretend</hi> to be his, are divers ſenſes.

That is the ſenſe we call <hi>Ianſenius his ſenſe,</hi> and which alſo the Pope intends. And therefore it was, that in the purſuance of his Bull he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all Books that defend that ſenſe, and namely the Paper of Three Columns. That is to ſay, he condemns the expreſſion, which <hi>Ianſenius</hi> and the <hi>Ianſenists</hi> themſelves have made of their Doctrine in the Five Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>In a word, the Pope having declar'd that he has condemn'd the Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> we preſs the Janſeniſts with their own Maximes, ſo as 'twill be impoſſible for them to eſcape without retracting what they have ſaid, or renouncing the infallibility of the Church.

It would be difficult to finde elſewhere, ſave among the Janſeniſts, ſuch couragious ſpirits as durſt deny ſo known a verity, and maintain, that the Hereticall Propoſitions, and thoſe of <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> ſet over againſt them, agree in nothing, neither as to words nor ſenſe; and that they are different expreſſions.

               <p>Now by this whole diſcourſe it appears, that their argument, who complain of being termed Heretiques, is retorted on themſelves: and ſerves for nothing, but to evidence their confuſion. They make an Induction from the <hi>Arians, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Eutychians,</hi> and <hi>Men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>thelites,</hi> who have been acknowledg'd as Heretiques for not renouncing Propoſitions condemned by the Church, but defending them, notwithſtanding that condemation: and they would perſwade us, they proceed not like thoſe men, for that they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely condemn the Propoſitions condemned by the Pope; and conſequently ought not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Heretiques like thoſe. But by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent diſcourſe it appears, that the Janſeniſts act the ſame part that thoſe Heretiques did. For the Pope condemn'd the Five Propoſitions as Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and as containing the Senſe and Doctrine of <hi>Ianſenius:</hi> and affirm'd them in that Senſe to be <hi>Hereticall.</hi> But the Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts to this day defend them in that ſenſe, and ſtoutly deny them to be Hereticall in that ſenſe. Therefore the Janſeniſts are <hi>Heretiques,</hi> as were the <hi>Arians, Neſtorians, Eutychians, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites.</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:96350:210"/>
And 'tis impoſſible they ſhould clear themſelves, till they deal candidly, and confeſſe what is daily expected from them, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Ianſenius</hi> is Hereticall.</p>
               <p>But if they run back to their old ſong, that they know not what the Doctrine of <hi>Ianſenius</hi> is, we have already anſwered, that the <hi>Ianſenian Doctours</hi> know it by their own ſtudy; that they have avow'd it, that they cannot be ignorant of it; that it is ocularly made manifeſt to all, that can but underſtand what they read; that this Doctrine is expreſſed in the Five Propoſitions. And for ſuch as cannot read, or are not able to underſtand what they read, and yet obſtinately follow that Belief, they are Heretiques, in regard that being oblig'd by the conſcience of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity and want of Schollerſhip, to refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the judgement of the ableſt Divines, they prefer the Opinion of three or four <hi>Doctors of Port-Royall,</hi> before the judgement of the <hi>Pope, and Church of</hi> Rome, of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and all other <hi>Univerſities,</hi> and in a word of the whole Church: for that muſt needs be attributed to the whole Church, which is received by a part incomparably greater then that which contradicts it; nay, which alone makes the whole Church, by excommunicating and cutting off the part reſiſting.

                  </gap>ruple to affirm, that it is alſo an act againſt Faith, and an Hereſie to contradict her therein?</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſeeing an Authority, ſufficient to oblige a man that acts rationally, (ſuch as is the authority of the Pope, Biſhops, and Doctours) propoſes the Doctrine of <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> as a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine containing errours, and condemned under the notion of Hereſie; though we knew no more of it then this, yet that alone ought to ſuffice for believing in generall that <hi>Ianſenius</hi>'s Doctrine contains errors contrary to the Catholique Faith; and conſequently it ſufficeth for the calling of thoſe people <hi>Heretiques,</hi> who obſtinately defend it, and contradict the Declarution of the Church, without further need of a particular information of thoſe errours.</p>
               <p>I know 'tis no matter of Faith, to believe that a man call'd <hi>Ianſenius</hi> was ever in the world, that he was a Biſhop, and writ a Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Auguſtinus;</hi> and that he treats in that Book of Queſtions of Grace, Predeſtination, and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:96350:212"/>
Free-will; but uppoſing the experimental, certain, and indubitable knowledge men have thereof, I maintain, that it is a matter of Faith to believe, that the Doctrine which is known to have been treated by that man, in that Book, and upon that Subject, is in ſome points Hereticall; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that this cannot be contradicted, but by an Heretique. Like as it was not an act of Faith, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, to believe that he was a man, and that he preached and ſpake of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> but it was an act of Faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that that mans preaching, whom they ſaw and heard, was true; and an act of infidelity to deny it, ſuppoſing the knowledge of the motives that rendred it credible.</p>
               <p>But if we muſt deſcend to the Five Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in particular, though it were granted to the Janſeniſts, that 'tis no point of Faith, that they are in <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> or that in him they have a ſenſe conſonant to their ſignification; yet they that can tell, how the Church has ſpoken of them, and know that thoſe Propoſitions either are in <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> or have there that ſenſe, perform an act of Faith in believing, that thoſe Propoſitions they ſo know to be <hi>Ianſenius</hi>'s, or in his Doctrine to have a ſenſe agreeable to their ſignification, are Hereticall in that ſenſe: and they that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it are Heretiques.</p>
               <p>In like manner anſwer is to be made to what they alledge, that true it is, who ever affirms At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, ſuch as the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it muſt be ſaid, that ſince the Definition of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> they who ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge either by their own ſtudy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>It is juſt here, as in the Baptiſme of Infants. For 'tis no matter of Faith, but rather of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Science, or Knowledge, that there are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Infants who receive Baptiſme. Yet that knowledge ſuppos'd, it is matter of Faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are juſtified; and to believe the contrary is the Hereſie of the Anabaptiſts. We muſt therefore ſay by the ſame reaſon, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is evident, both by the Janſeniſts own confeſſion above reported, and by ocular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the thing it ſelf, that the condemned Propoſitions meet with their ſenſe in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and that the ſame Doctrine may be underſtood by the expreſſion of thoſe Propoſitions; it cannot be denyed, but that the Maintainers of them in <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s ſenſe are Heretiques, by the ſame principle, by which they maintain that the <hi>Arians, Neſtorians, Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Monothelites were ſuch;</hi> that is to ſay, becauſe they formally contradict the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Church.</p>

are Hereticall; the Janſeniſts affirm, That the Five Propoſitions taken in <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s ſenſe are <hi>the moſt conſtant verities of Catholique Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> This is acting the Wolf, and declaring point-blank againſt the Church, which is Chriſts Flock. Yet they ſay withall, they condemn the Five Propoſitions <hi>where ever they finde them.</hi> Now that's to play the Fox, to wit, by a mentall reſervation, and exception of <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s ſenſe; which nevertheleſſe is that ſenſe, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church.</p>
               <p>I ſay nothing of their acting the Sheep, by that Innocence and Sanctity of life, which they vaunt of, and which they endeavour to confirm even by Miracles. And to ſay but the truth, they work Miracles to prove their Sanctity far greater then any man is able to believe. For what greater Miracle in perſons that regard onely the love of God; <hi>thenthen the accord, which they make betwixt that love, and the hatred of their Neighbour;</hi> which they have ſhown from the beginning, and that even before they could pretend to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd any diſpleaſure from men? 'Tis well known, that when <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s Book was firſt brought into <hi>France,</hi> one of their Patriarchs, who laboured to engage many Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> in the defence of that Doctrine, and begg'd their Approbations, having met with one of thoſe Doctours, who would not be perſwaded by his other reaſons, to approve the Book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reading it, as ſome of his Colleagues had done, he had recourſe to his laſt reaſon, which he thought ſo prevalent that he could not but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, and ſhewing him the Book, <hi>Behold,</hi>

But is it not a great miracle, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile ſo charitable an intention as this, with that purified Zeal for the love of God, whereof they make profeſſion?</p>
               <p>And is not that another great Miracle which appears in their Letters, <hi>viz. The attonement of Juſtice, (which is ſo dear to them) with the liberty of calumniating?</hi> Their Calumnies are ſo clearly diſplay'd in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </opener>
               <p>THe ſeventeenth Letter of the Secretary of <hi>Port-Royall</hi> is now newly arriv'd; da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the 23. of <hi>January,</hi> and publiſhed the 29. of <hi>February.</hi> All the <hi>Interim</hi> was but requiſite for its journey from <hi>Oſuabruck,</hi> where he affirms it was Printed; the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> being unwilling to put it to the Preſs at <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s;</hi> ſo obedient they are to the Civil State and to the Ordinances of the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>It is a long Letter of the ſize of the other ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; which like the precedent (by me newly anſwered) tends to prove, that the Janſeniſts are no Hereticks. For, as to their merited title of <hi>Impoſtors</hi> and <hi>Falſifiers</hi> in their Letters to the Provincial, (which was all I pretended to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in my Book, of <hi>The fair dealing of the</hi>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:96350:236"/>
                  <hi>Janſeniſts)</hi> their Secretary yields us the victory; and will no longer contend but with thoſe that call them <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as I had occaſionally done in the Preface of the Book. From this accuſation he intends to vindicate the Party, by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between the judgements of the Pope and Councils touching queſtions of Fact, and their judgements concerning queſtions of Right; the former not being infallible, as it may be the later are; and by the unqueſtionable certitude of the Doctrine of <hi>Efficacious Grace,</hi> (that is, Grace efficacious <hi>of it ſelf)</hi> maintained in the Writings of <hi>Janſenius;</hi> and which there is no probability that the Pope intended to touch.</p>
               <p>By this it appears that the Secretary played the <hi>Schoolman</hi> at the beginning, in his firſt four Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, diſputing againſt the cenſure of <hi>Sorbon;</hi> and perceiving that he advanced little by ſtriving to overbear a judgement maintain'd by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope and Biſhops, was forc'd to fall upon the <hi>Jeſuites Morall,</hi> which furniſh'd him with the matter of the Twelve following Letters. But being alſo driven out of that field by the conviction of his falſities, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e returns again to the Scholaſtick in his Seventeenth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of the infallibility of Pope and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells; and of the truth of the Doctrine of <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would require a Letter longer then his, to refute all his extravagances, illuſions, bravadoes, falſhoods, vanities, and all that he ſpeaks imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, and contrary to the reſpect he owes to the Sea Apoſtoſique. I ſhall onely take notice of his two principall <hi>Mediums</hi> to prove that he is
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:96350:237"/>
no Heretique. As to the firſt, which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of difference between deciſions of Fact, and deciſions of Right, the Reader will ſee, that there is nothing neceſſary to be added to what I have latelely ſaid in anſwer to the <hi>Janſeniſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint;</hi> and that the ſtories he reports concerning Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> and others, avail him not at all.</p>
               <p>As to the point of <hi>Self-efficacious Grace,</hi> the good Secretary underſtands it very ill, and ſhews not onely that he is no Doctor, (as he confeſſeth of himſelf) but that he deſerves not to be one. He pretends that the Five Propoſitions are not hereticall in <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s ſenſe, if that ſenſe be no more then the Doctrine of <hi>Efficatious Grace;</hi> not ſeeing that by the ſame argument <hi>Calvin</hi> may juſtifie his Doctrine on the ſame ſubject; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, that he pretends nothing elſe, but to defend the verity of <hi>Efficacious Grace.</hi> The Secretary muſt learn, that there are two wayes of defending <hi>Efficacious Grace,</hi> one which is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, and relying upon Hereticall Principles: the other Orthodox, maintained by Principles eſtabliſhed in Councills. <hi>Calvin</hi> follows the firſt, and is therein Hereticall: The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Doctors, <hi>Thomiſts, Scotiſts, Sorboniſts, Jeſuits</hi> agree in the ſecond: and therefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their particular diſputes, they all remain in unity of Faith, and in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church.</p>
               <p>To know therefore whether <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be ſecured by his profeſſion of defending <hi>Efficacious Grace,</hi> it muſt be known which way he defends it; whether by <hi>Calvin</hi>'s way, or that of the Catholique Doctors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:96350:237"/>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> ſo defends <hi>Effcacious Grace,</hi> that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it leaves us no other liberty, then the <hi>liberty from coaction, or conſtraint;</hi> ſubjecting us in other reſpects, to a <hi>neceſſity of acting;</hi> which deprives us of the power of reſiſting it, ſo long as Grace perſeveres.</p>
               <p>The Catholique Doctors agree that <hi>Efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Grace</hi> ſo rules the Will, as it leaves us <hi>a power</hi> of diſſenting; ſo that theſe two things are found together, Grace in the Will, and in the ſame Will under Grace <hi>a power</hi> ſufficient to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its conſenting to Grace: and they doubt not, but this is the true ſenſe of the words of the Councill of <hi>Trent, Poteſt diſſentire. Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez</hi> and <hi>Molina,</hi> and all Catholique Doctours, even the moſt divided in their opinions, and the moſt oppoſite in the diſputes of Grace, are united in this point.</p>
               <p>They are ſo likewiſe in this other, That Grace under that formality of <hi>efficacious,</hi> is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to good actions, as that it cannot be <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> without it, and give us <hi>all power</hi> requiſite to make that which God requireth of us, and which yet we perform not, to be truly <hi>poſſible</hi> to us, even when we fail to do it; whence it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens, that through our own fault, Grace attains not its effect.</p>
               <p>I ask the Secretary therefore, whether <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> be of that opinion, when he teaches, that we need not fear <hi>leſt neceſſity, by what name ſoever call'd,</hi> deprive us of liberty, ſo it be not a <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of coaction?</hi> Or when he diſputes againſt the indifference of liberty, and leaves us not any that <hi>Calvin</hi> has denied; nor acknowledges
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:96350:238"/>
any that <hi>Calvin</hi> has not likewiſe acknowledged? Or when he takes <hi>ſufficient</hi> Grace for <hi>a Monſter in Divinity,</hi> and denies, that there was ever any medicinall Grace, that had not its effect? Or when he imputes as errour to the <hi>Semipelagians</hi> their ſaying, <hi>That the Will can obey or reſiſt Grace?</hi> And ſeeing it is evident, that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is diſſonant to the Catholique Doctours way of explaining <hi>Self-efficacious Grace,</hi> and is rather conſonant to that followed by <hi>Calvin,</hi> it muſt be concluded, that reducing the ſenſe of the Five condemned Propoſitions to the ſenſe of <hi>Efficacious Grace,</hi> as it has been explicated by <hi>Janſenius,</hi> is to reduce it to an hereticall ſenſe: and that all they who follow this explication, are not onely Diſciples of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> but of <hi>Calvin</hi> too.</p>
               <p>Whence it appears, that the Secretary accuſes me in vain for having granted, that the deceaſed Pope touched not, in his Conſtitution, the Controverſie of <hi>Efficacious Grace.</hi> For in the <hi>Cavilli,</hi> from whence he hath taken it, I ſpeak expreſly of the point in controverſie between the Fathers of St. <hi>Dominique</hi>'s Order, and the <hi>Jeſui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es.</hi> 'Tis very true, the Pope was not willing to touch that; but he touched the point wherein they and we are agreed, in confirming it by the condemnation of the Hereſie of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> which is oppoſite to it, as being the ſenſe of <hi>Calvin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore 'tis no wonder if the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> have every where ſtretch'd forth their arms to embrace the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> owning them for their School-fellows. The Proteſtant <hi>Cantons,</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Henry Ottius,</hi> chief Profeſſor of

The Pope hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Five Propoſitions, condemned in <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth's Bull, are Hereticall in <hi>Janſenius</hi> his ſenſe: you ſay thoſe Five Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not Hereticall in <hi>Janſenius</hi> his ſenſer And for this you are deſervedly called Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.

               <p>I know, Sir, you bring many Arguments to
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:96350:242"/>
vindicate your ſelf, and to prove, That the Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts are no Heretiques. But I ſhall, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhew you the nullity of them. But before I come to that, to diſintangle the matter, I think fit to refute two Things, which ſerve you for Bravadoes onely, and matter of Calumny; not for any argument to prove that the Janſeniſts are no Heretiques. The one of theſe things is, what you ſay concerning your ſelf: The other, what you lay to the Jeſuites, which is ſo mixt with the Arguments you bring, that it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to take it apart, that both it, and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be clearly anſwered.</p>
               <p>For your ſelf then, Sir, you ſay (pag. 296. of the ſecond Engliſh Edition; which is that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes follow in this Letter.) That you are <hi>alone.</hi> And pray, Sir, how came you to be <hi>alone?</hi> 'Twas becauſe you ſeparated your ſelf from the Catholique Church. You are <hi>alone.</hi> And ſo was <hi>Arius, Eutyches, Neſtorius,</hi> and all other Arch-Heretiques, when they firſt began to oppoſe the Church. You are <hi>alone;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe you cannot be argued of Hereſie: you ſhould have diſcourſed quite contray. You are <hi>alone,</hi> and therefore to be ſuſpected: for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts cannot (likely) be ſound in Faith. But, Sir, if you be <hi>alone,</hi> as you ſay you are, without relation to any, how cometh it, that in the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Letter, pag. 337. &amp;c. you take upon you to make Proclamations in the publique cauſe of all the Janſeniſts? Who intruſted you to ſpeak in their name, and to deliver their ſenſe? How ſhall we believe what you tell us, That they will ſubmit, when the places are ſhewed them in <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius;</hi>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:96350:242"/>
or when this Pope ſhall have again heard them at <hi>Rome?</hi> How ſhall we know, that they are not already ſatisfied in their conſcience? Since as you ſay, you are <hi>alone,</hi> and have no relation to them of <hi>Port-Royall,</hi> that is, to the Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts. No, No, Sir, you are not <hi>alone;</hi> you ſpeak for the whole Party; you are the mouth of the Caball; you act for all the Janſeniſts: And if they ſhould deſert you, you would not yet be <hi>alone;</hi> for the Calviniſts, the Lutherans, the Anabaptiſts, the Quakers, and all that renounce Obedience to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would ſhake hands with you. You know well enough, your Letters were welcome at <hi>Charenton,</hi> and are made much of in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and all the Nations, which are divided from the Faith of the Catholique Church, Say therefore no more, That you are <hi>alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing that you ſay for your ſelf is, That you are <hi>hid,</hi> and the Jeſuites finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wounded from your <hi>inviſible hand,</hi> pag. 297. A Thief might well comfort himſelf with this; it is his happineſſe to be <hi>hidden. Omnis, qui malè agit, odit lucem.</hi> Every one that doth evill, would gladly be inviſible. But that Truth ſhould ſeek hiding-holes in a place where it may ſafely appear, (as in <hi>France</hi> any Catholique Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may) that, Sir, I never heard. Appear therefore; or elſe every one will conclude againſt you: for every one knoweth, that he is to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in all he ſaith, who is forced to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like an Out-law; and is ſo forſaken of all, <hi>that</hi> (as you ſpeak of your ſelf) <hi>he hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to any Community, nor to any perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</hi>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:96350:243"/>
Embrace therefore the Truth, and you will not need to hide your ſelf: The Catholique Church is viſible; and you need not make your ſelf inviſible, unleſſe it be to become a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the inviſible Church, which is not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
               <p>The third Thing you ſay for your ſelf is, That you make a Proteſtation of your Faith in theſe words, pag. 296. <hi>I have not any dependance ſave that on the Catholique, Apoſtolique, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, where I am reſolved to live and die in the Communion of the Pope, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Head thereof; out of which I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded there is no Salvation. Then you ask, what courſe can be taken with one, that talkes after this rate?</hi> You know, Sir, <hi>what courſe</hi> can be, and is, taken, with you, for all this; you know, that the Decree made <hi>feriâ quintâ, die ſexto Septembris,</hi> 1657. telleth us, That Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh condemneth this very Letter of yours together with all the reſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Proteſtation. Theſe words indeed, if they be reall, might prove you no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant; but not no Janſeniſt. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe words you maintain Janſeniſme; you ſpit your venome at his Holineſſe, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn his Bulls, and calumniate thoſe, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſwade all to ſubmit to the cenſures of the Church: I mean the Jeſuites, of whom (to come to that) you tell us.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place this, pag. 298. <hi>There is a vaſte difference between the Jeſuites, and them that oppoſe them. They do really make up one Body, united under one Head; and their Rules</hi>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:96350:243"/>
                  <hi>allow them not to print any thing without the Approbation of Superiours, who by that means become accountable for their Errours: whereas you are accountable to no body for what you write; nor no body reſponſible for you.</hi> All this you ſay to tax the Jeſuites, and prove your ſelf irreprehenſible; and you do not mark, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally you commend the Jeſuites in it, and diſgrace your ſelf, and diſcover the Source of your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Had any man adviſed you, and reviewed your Papers before they went to the Preſſe, they would not have been ſo full of groſſe errours. Had you had any dependance on any learned and vertuous man, he would have told you, that you could not impute to the Society the inventing of the Doctrine of Probabilities, and the like, which had been taught ſome hundred of years, before the Society was in the world. He would have told you, That to cite Auhours falſely, as you do almoſt perpetually, was a direct means to diſgrace your own Writings; that to tax good opinions, was but to diſcover the blindeneſſe of your own paſſion; that to joyn with Janſeniſts, was but to declare againſt the Church. In fine, he would have told you all that, which ſince to your ſhame you have been told by thoſe who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered your Letters, and laid your ignorance open to the world: and by this means he would have ſaved your labour, ſaved your credit, and ſaved your conſcience. But your having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on any body, made you leap headlong into the precipice, into which your paſſion lead you blindefold.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, the Jeſuites by the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:96350:244"/>
which they have from their Superiours, have ſtood firm, and their Doctrine, like a rock in the Sea, hath received the boiſterous waves of your calumnies and contradictions, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever ſhaken in the leaſt point. I do not ſay this to averre that all their Writings are irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible; I know ſome Jeſuites have writ things which the Pope hath cenſured, (as that, which you take notice of, of Father <hi>Halloix)</hi> and they have willingly ſubmitted to his Holineſs's cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: Some opinions alſo have been unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impugned by all the reſt of their Order, and forbid by their Generall. This is allowed. Yet that which I ſay is, that their Doctrine as to all your Objctions, hath ſtood unſhaken and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. And as I did in the Preface to the Impoſtures, ſo again I defie you (according to the conditions which there are ſet down) to ſhew me any one point of the <hi>Morall Doctrine</hi> of the Society, which is reprehenſible. If by the Popes admonition, or of themſelves, they diſcover any errour in any particular Authour of theirs, they preſently correct it. So for example, that which you alledge of Father <hi>Amicus</hi> in your Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Letter, was long ſince commanded by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Generall</hi> to be razed out of the Book; though <hi>Amicus</hi> were not the firſt, nor the onely Authour, that had taught that opinion. Now that in a great number of Writers it ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen, that an unallowable opinion ſhould eſcape correction for a time, is a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able errour of hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne frailty. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is laudable vertue that maketh them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any ſuch errour, aſſoon as it is known.
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:96350:244"/>
This advantage then Subordination to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours brings to them, that their errours are ſoon corrected; nor can they be taxed for what they themſelves endeavour to redreſſe in the frailty of particulars: much leſſe are their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours criminall, if perhaps ſome one or two opinions chance to diſpleaſe.</p>
               <p>For that which you bring concerning the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the Superiours, is too frivolous to need an Anſwer. It is ſenſeleſſe to think, that the Generall of the Society, from whom all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Printing is derived, can view all the Books written by the whole Order. If we ſhould allow their Generall (that which is never heard of in one man) abilities enough to judge of all the Books, writ by the ſeverall Authours of the Society in all the ſeverall Sciences; at leaſt we cannot think, that he knoweth all the languages, in which they are written: nor can he poſſibly have time to read them all; no, nor is it practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally poſſible to conveigh them all to him, from the ſeverall places of the world, over which the Jeſuites are ſpread. Theſe are fabulous dreams, fit for you, Sir, to make matter of a Calumny with, but not to be believed by any rationall man. All that he can do is this. He deputes ſome able men, three or four, to view every Work that is to be printed; and then he regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates himſelf according to their judgement. Now when this is done, as it is among the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites very exactly, it ſeldom happeneth, that their Books need the Popes Cenſure: if they do, then aſſoon as the errour is perceived, it is their deſire to correct it. All this I have ſaid to ſatisfie the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:96350:245"/>
Reader; who by this will judge, that as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily happen, that the writings of the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites ſhould be ſcandalous, ſo it may happen, that the three or four Reviſours, whoſe judgement muſt carry it for the preſent, may be overſeen: ſuch is the nature of humane frailty. And if any man can ſinde a better way, the Jeſuites will thank him for it.</p>

It is, that Father <hi>Annat</hi> (and the ſame is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the reſt) <hi>produces the Piety and Zeal of their Adverſaries</hi> as a mark of their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. I anſwer, that it is not their true piety, but their falſe piety, their Hypocriticall Mummery which the Jeſuites take as a mark of their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. That which Chriſt noted in the Phariſees, <hi>That they ſtrained a Gnat, and ſwallowed a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell.</hi> For example, whileſt you will not allow a Penitent to follow his Ghoſtly Fathers opinion, for fear of the Monſter of Probability, you will, and do, allow thoſe poor Souls of <hi>Port-Royall,</hi> to abſtain Fifteen Moneths from Communion, contrary to the expreſs precept of the Church. Whileſt you will not allow, that a man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his goods, or honour, from an unjuſt Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, you will allow, with the Abbot of St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> that a man may, and muſt ſometimes, kill himſelf. Whileſt you cry out againſt Revenge, you teach, that to follow the interior Inſpiration (ſo you call it) a man may, though contrary to
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:96350:245"/>
the exteriour Law, kill his Neighbour. Whileſt you cry out againſt the Jeſuites admitting men unworthily to the Sacraments, you commend it as an act of great Humility to be content to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Communion all ones life long till the laſt hour. 'Tis this impious Doctrine, (that you call <hi>Piety)</hi> which the Jeſuites take for a mark of Hereſie. Theſe and the like Maximes of you Janſeniſts are cited in the Impoſtures, and in the Anſwers to your Letters, and juſtly taken by the Jeſuites for marks of people fallen from the way of Truth.</p>
               <p>The third thing, which you ſay concerning the Jeſuites, is very often inculcated by you, but moſt largely in the Eighteenth Letter, pag. 343. &amp;c.

this? All the world knoweth, that Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the Tenth was moved by the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> to examine the Five Propoſitions, which they preſented him taken out of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> Were there any Jeſuites in that Synod? All the world knows, that among thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to examine at <hi>Rome,</hi> there was but one Jeſuit. For although Cardinall <hi>Lugo,</hi> a Jeſuit of Eminent Learning, was alſo to have been one, yet at the Janſeniſts petition he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. So that of Thirteen Examiners there was but one Jeſuit; and his Cenſures, as you report them, the furtheſt from taxing the Five Propoſitions, that could be expected. Where then did the Jeſuites appear in all this buſineſſe? What did they do? Whom did they work upon? Certainly, Sir, you would not have been ſilent, if you had any thing to produce againſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You tell us two things, which are meer Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, not Probations. One is, that <hi>Janſenius</hi> had taxed <hi>Molina</hi> a Jeſuite of fifty errours. What then? Do you imagine <hi>Janſenius</hi> ſo great a Divine, that <hi>Molina</hi> muſt fly for his cenſures? I believe, no Jeſuit ever thought ſo; and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it hath not proved ſo, but quite contrary: <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Book is cenſured as Hereticall, and <hi>Molina</hi> ſtandeth in as good repute as ever. But allow, that <hi>Janſenius</hi> had found five hundred true faults in <hi>Molina;</hi> doth that prove, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>miſe, <hi>That the Jeſuites hold this Maxime, as one of the moſt Authentique of all their Theology,</hi> viz. <hi>That they may without crime calumniate thoſe, by whom they think they are unjuſtly moleſted.</hi> Letter 18. pag. 343. I will not anſwer this falſe reproach with that uncivill language, which your Friend pag. 325. giveth Father <hi>Annat</hi> the Kings Confeſſour. Though you deſerve it, yet I ſcorn foul language. But you muſt give me leave to tell you, that you are extreamly out. Never any Jeſuite taught this Maxime as you ſet it down: ſo far are they from holding it one of the moſt Authentique Maximes of their Theology. A Jeſuite holdeth it a crime to lie: and truly ſhould I know any of them, that ſhould think they might calumniate others falſely, I ſhould eſteem them far otherwiſe then I do You may therefore file this up with the other falſe Calnmnies, you laid on the Jeſuites; for this Propoſition cannot be found any where but in your Letters: no Jeſuite ever taught it; no, I dare ſay no Catholique Doctour ever imagined it.</p>
               <p>Of like falſity with this are thoſe unjuſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which you in ſeveral places of your Letters caſt on the Jeſuites; (which I note in the fourth place) you ſay pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 351. <hi>That the Jeſuits raiſe a diſturbance in the Church,</hi> whileſt it is evident, that they endeavour to allay the diſturbance which you raiſe. All they do is to preach and
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:96350:247"/>
teach doctrine conſonant to the Popes Bulls, to the ſenſe of the Church, to that which Kings and Princes, and all Catholique Biſhops and Doctors allow of, and agree in. To be obedient is not to raiſe diſturbance; but to be refractory, as you are, is to raiſe diſturbance. Therefore Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> juſtly calleth the Janſeniſts, <hi>perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores quietis publicae,</hi> perturbatours of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique peace, becauſe they raiſe diſturbance in the Church.</p>
               <p>Again you ſay, pag. 303. <hi>That the Jeſuits daily faſten new Hereſies on the Janſeniſts. Firſt, the Propoſitions were called Heretical; then their quality was urged, then it was tranſlated to</hi> word for word; <hi>then it was brought into the heart; then into the hand.</hi> To all this I anſwer, that whereas you attribute to the Jeſuites the faſtening of Hereſie on their Adverſaries, you cannot be ignorant, that they never did call you Heretiques, till the Pope had firſt defined it, and the Biſhops and whole Church allowed it. Nor hath there been any change in the Church as to this point. What Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> firſt defined, that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> did again define: and becauſe you had found new evaſions, he added a fuller declaration. All the change was on your parts. Firſt you ſaid the Propoſitions were in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> but were not Hereticall: then you ſaid they were Hereticall, but not in <hi>Janſenius.</hi> And when the places were ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:96350:247"/>
that the Bulls ſhould be received. You are the <hi>Proteus's</hi> that change daily your ſhape to elude the force of the Popes Conſtitutions: and ſo you are for this reaſon called by Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in his Bull, <hi>Filii iniquitatis, Sonnes of Iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally to end this matter, you ſay the Jeſuites quarrel is at the perſon of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> pag. 340. not at his errours. But the contrary is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: for you cannot ſay, that ever they did any thing againſt his perſon; and you will not deny, but they have alwayes been againſt his errours.</p>
               <p>But now I come to your arguments, by which you would prove, that the Janſeniſts are not to be called Heretiques. I will ſet them down by way of Objections, not as they lie in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but according to the connexion of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them: nor will I obſerve your words, which abound with Tautologies and frivolous excurſions. But I will put them in ſome-form, as much as they will bear; that when they are ſeen in their full force, the anſwer may be the better underſtood.

For to make the Conſequence good you muſt ſuppoſe this Propoſition true, <hi>No man can be called an Heretique, unleſs it be an Article of Faith, that he be an Heretique:</hi> which is extreamly falſe. For as in other crimes, ſo in Hereſie, a Moral, or Phyſical evidence is enough to condemn any one of Hereſie. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I hear one tell me ſeriouſly and often, that he doth not believe the Three Perſons of the Trinity; and that though he know the Church believeth a Trinity, yet he doth not, nor will not believe it; without any controverſie I may judge this man an Heretique: although it is not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith, either that he is a man, or that I hear him ſpeak. Again, ſuppoſe I do not hear him ſpeak, but hear from irrefragable witneſſe of many honeſt and underſtanding men, that he hath made this profeſſion deliberately, or that he printeth and teacheth this; without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:96350:248"/>
I may judge him an Heretique: and yet it is not matter of Faith, that theſe witneſſes tell me true. But it is enough to have either a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, or Morall Evidence to judge one an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique. And this (as I ſaid) is common to all crimes, as well as Hereſie. The Iudge, when he condemneth a man to death for murther, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not put it in his Creed, that infallibly this man hath committed Murther: nor needeth he have Phyſicall Certainty, but 'tis enough that he have a Morall Evidence, <hi>Secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> (as the Law ſaith) according to what is alledged and proved by witneſſes; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding may all erre. Iuſt ſo in cur caſe, though it were allowed not to be of Faith, that the Five condemned Propoſitions are in <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his Book, yet without ſcruple we may, and in reaſon ought to condemn the Book as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall; the Church having condemned it for ſuch.

of the ſeverall Briefs made by Pope <hi>Urban</hi> againſt <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Book, the Five Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were extracted out of his Book by the Synod of <hi>France,</hi> who profeſſe to have uſed all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in examining them.

I anſwer, That underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as you do, Propoſitions written in any Book to be matter of Fact, 'tis a perfect madneſſe to aſſert, that none can be declared Heretiques for matter of Fact. And the Conſequences of that Aſſertion are ſo evidently abſurd and Hereticall, that nothing can be more. For firſt it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that never any Propoſition in any Book could be declared Hereticall: for ſtill you would ſay, it is ridiculous, that any man ſhould be an Heretique for matter of Fact; and ſtill it would be matter of Fact, whether the Propoſition were in the Book, or no: and ſo no Books could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Church. Secondly it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that no perſon whatſoever could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and that we muſt not believe, that ever there was any Heretique in the Church, that can be named; (except thoſe that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture) though St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>Oportet haereſes eſſe:</hi> and ſo we ſhould never be obliged to avoid any one as an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, contrary to what I alledged in the firſt Objection out of the Apoſtle. For ſtill it will

                     </gap>s or that, is matter of Fact. Thirdly it would follow, that as no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in any Book could be defined by the Church to be Hereticall; ſo on the contrary no Propoſition in any Book could be defined Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, or to be conſonant to the word of God, or the true word of God. And ſo we ſhould by your wiſe argument come to doubt of every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, even in the Holy Scripture. For ſtill it will be (according to your ridiculous Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>matter of Fact whether that Propoſition be in Scripture. And certainly it is as clear mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, whether the Scripture ſaith, <hi>God will have all men ſaved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth,</hi> as it is, whether <hi>Janſenius</hi> in his Book ſaith, <hi>Chriſt did not die for all men.</hi> And ſo by this argument we ſhall never be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to admit any Propoſition as Scripture; which is to ſay we may deny, by your argument, all Scripture. And further, as to the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is as much matter of Fact, whether this or that Edition of Scripture be true Scripture, as whether the Five Propoſitions be in <hi>Janſenius:</hi> yet the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath declared, that the <hi>Vulgat Edition</hi> ſhall be held Authenticall, and he would be an Heretique, that would not allow it.</p>

                  <p>Many Learned men have read <hi>Janſenius</hi> all over, and cannot finde the Five Propoſitions; therefore they are not there: and ſo the Synod of <hi>France,</hi> and the Popes, who condemned thoſe Propoſitions as <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s erred. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer firſt, that this is a Negative Argument,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:96350:251"/>
and ſo in effect proves nothing againſt the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Aſſertion of the Synod of <hi>France,</hi> which found them there; and the Definition of the Pope, who defineth that they are there. But to anſwer again, I ask who were thoſe ſixty Perſons that read <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and could not finde thoſe Propoſitions? Perhaps Doctour St. <hi>Beauve</hi> was one, whom pag. 300. you call <hi>the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour in Sorbon;</hi> but you do not tell us, that he was turn'd out of his place for Ianſeniſme: which I have from a good hand. Or were you one, Sir? If you were, and the reſt like you, I do not wonder that you could not finde the Propoſitions in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> though they be there. You that could finde, in ſo many Authours of the Jeſuites as you have falſely cited, that which is not there, might have the trick of not finding in <hi>Janſenius</hi> that which is there. It is a great deal eaſier to read an Author, and not to find that which is there, then to finde there that which is not there; as you, Sir, are evidently convinced to have done. The Fourteenth Impoſture, and the ſmall piece of <hi>Leſſius</hi> inſerted in the end of this Book, maketh this evident. You can finde, or ſay you finde, in <hi>Leſſius</hi> that which he hath not: and why may you not more eaſily not finde, or ſay you cannot finde, in <hi>Janſenius</hi> that which is clearly there. You therefore, when you tell us that above ſixty <note n="*" place="bottom">

But you tell us, (Letter 18. pag. 330.) 'Tis the Jeſuites you mean; 'tis they cannot cite the places, and yet they call you Heretiques. And what then, Sir? Suppoſe no Jeſuite in the world could cite the places, muſt the Church therefore be out? or muſt the Ieſuites not give the Propoſitions the ſame name, which the Popes and univerſall Church gives them, that is, to call them Hereticall, and condemned in <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> his ſenſe, and as they lie in <hi>Janſenius?</hi>

                     </gap>uly, Sir, I cannot hold laughing, when I read page 342. that you define the Ieſuits to cite the places of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> as you have cited their corrupt Maximes; which is to ſay, that you deſire them to cite wrong places: for you know, Sir, you never cite right.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, that the world may ſee how impudent you are, and how reſolved to deny Truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you finde it, I deſire all to take notice, that long before your Seventeenth or Eighteenth Letter, (where you urge this Argument ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently) the places were cited, and publiquely allowed to be truly cited, and that even by your own ſelves, as is evidently convinced in Father <hi>Annats</hi> Anſwer to the Ianſeniſts Complaint, where you have the Ianſeniſts own confeſſion, and the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Tomiſts</hi> Doctrine is Catholique, as all allow: But the Five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are not Catholique, as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth: Therefore the <hi>Tomiſts</hi> do not teach the ſame with <hi>Janſenius</hi> his five Propoſitions.</p>

This diſcourſe you ſnarle at; yet it is a great deal better then yours. For your diſcourſe erreth in the firſt Principle of all Diſcourſe; which is to argue <hi>à notioribus ad minus nota,</hi> from the things that are more known, to thoſe that are leſſe known. Whereas you do quite contrary; and out of the leſſe known and leſſe certain you would overthrow the more known and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, You would overthrow the plain ſenſe of the Bull by the Dominicans opinion. Now that the Dominicans opinion is as you ſay, is a thing leſſe known and leſſe certain, then the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bull; for two Reaſons. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Tomiſts</hi> or Dominicans (who can give the beſt account of their own Doctrine) abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny, that they hold as you ſay, that is, with <hi>Janſenius;</hi> and tell us, that you and the Calviniſts falſly impoſe on them that which they never taught. Secondly, becauſe that if really the Dominicans (which is not ſo) ſhould teach the Five Propoſitions, as <hi>Janſenius</hi> doth, it is certain and known to all Catholiques, that more credit is to be given to the Definitions of the Pope, then to any Sentiments of any particular School, either Jeſuits, or Dominicans, or Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, as every one of them will, and do allow: And ſo, if it were granted, that the Dominicans held the Five Propoſitions, yet that were a leſſe certainty, then what the Popes Definition gives.

                  <p>Father <hi>Annat</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Janſenius</hi> is juſtly condemned, becauſe he holdeth <hi>Calvins</hi> way concerning Efficacious Grace: But he doth not hold <hi>Calvins</hi> way, as is proved by many Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, wherein he condemneth <hi>Calvin:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Janſenius</hi> is not juſtly condemned. This is another of your ſubtle evaſions, to elude the Bull. To this I anſwer, That I am of Father <hi>Annats</hi> opinion, that there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Janſenius</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> as I conceive it may eaſily be proved. But whether Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> and I judge right or no, it importeth not. For though it were proved, That <hi>Janſenius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> held the Doctrine of Efficacious Grace in a very different manner, yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Pope hath not juſtly condemned <hi>Janſenius.</hi> All that followeth is, That Father <hi>Annat</hi> and I are out in our opinion; which will not prejudice the Church at all. The Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Bull are clear, and cannot be evert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my opinion, or Father <hi>Annats,</hi> or any bodies; they containing a greater certainty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then any private mans, or any particular Schools Opinion, as I ſaid to the Sixth Objection. And <hi>Calvin</hi> is condemned on another account, and was ſo, long before <hi>Janſenius</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>Now as to your defence, wherein you heap up Sentences of <hi>Janſenius</hi> againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> I muſt tell you firſt, That you, that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell

ſo much at others for not citing the Page of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> ought to have cited the page; eſpecially you being guilty of perpetuall forgery and falſification in your Citations. Secondly allowing (which is not granted) that the places are very truly cited, what followeth? Onely this, that <hi>Janſenius</hi> teacheth Contradictions. For in the places I have cited, he clearly teacheth all that is in the Five Propoſitions; and in the places that you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this Anſwer ſatisfieth alſo thoſe things, which you bring to clear your ſelf from Janſeniſme; by ſhewing, that you have ſaid many things contrary to the Five condemned Propoſitions: For though that be true, yet it is alſo true, that you maintain <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and ſay, the Five Propoſitions are not Hereticall in his ſenſe, which is enough to make you deſerve the name of Janſeniſt.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer firſt, that this Objection (were all true that is aſſumed) is extreamly frivolous. For

what? Two Popes ſay in their Bulls, that the Propoſitions are taken out of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and condemned in his ſenſe; and one of the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Examiners (as you make him to ſpeak) thought, before the Bull was out, that the Five Propoſitions could not be cenſured in <hi>Janſenius</hi> his ſenſe, or in the ſenſe of any other Authour, becauſe he conceived them to be preſented to the Examiners not as the Propoſitions of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.

Every Childe will tell you, that one Examiners opinion cannot prevail againſt the Popes Definition, in what matter ſoever, much leſſe in this.

Muſt your Senſes be judges of all the objects, which contain matter of Fact; ſo that neither Reaſon, nor Revelation, nor the Word of God, can contradict it? Fooliſh.

teacheth many things, that Reaſon cannot reach unto, though the object be not ſupernaturall; muſt not Reaſon yield to Faith, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is an object within the extent of Reaſon? For example to have a ſoul is a <hi>thing</hi> (to uſe your own words, pag. 347. li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 6, 7.) <hi>naturall and intelligible,</hi> of all which things you ſay rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is to be judge. Now ſuppoſe ſome one could not judge by any reaſon that occurreth to him, that he hath a ſoul; muſt that man never believe that men have ſouls? Again to judge of the preſence of a Body is an object of Senſe: I ſay there's fire, becauſe I either ſee it, or feel it. I ſay there's a man that ſpeaks, becauſe I hear him. I ſay this is bread, becauſe I taſte it. And yet, Sir, how far our Senſes are out ſometimes, is evident in the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar; where all Catholiques believe, (as you profeſſe you do alſo) that there is no Bread after the Conſecration, though the Sight, the Taſte, the Feeling, carry us to judge that there is Bread, as well after as before Conſecration.</p>
                  <p>Truly, Sir, when I reflect upon your bringing this Argument, to prove that which you often ſay, (as Let. 17. pag. 298, and Let. 18. pag. 351. and in many other places) <hi>That there are no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques in the Church, and that the Church is without Hereſie,</hi> I cannot but take great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of your blindeneſſe. I ſee you take for an argumenent <hi>that there is no Hereſie,</hi> that very thing, which is the originall Source and Cauſe of all Hereſie. You would have every ones reaſon judge of all the objects of reaſon; and ſenſe of all the objects of ſenſe: and ſo you ſweep away
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:96350:263"/>
all ſubmiſſion, all reſpect to authority, all capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the underſtanding in obedience to Faith: and by this very means you put an anſwer into every Heretiques mouth to maintain his perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity with. If the Antitrinitarians deny the Bleſſed Trinity, they tell you, 'tis againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If the Anabaptiſt refuſe to baptize his Childe, he telleth you, 'tis againſt reaſon. If the Quaker refuſe a civill reſpect (as to put off his hat) to any body, he telleth you, 'tis againſt reaſon. If the Proteſtant refuſe to believe the reall Preſence, he telleth you, 'tis againſt reaſon, and his ſenſe dictates to him the contrary. Now if you urge Scripture againſt theſe men, they will anſwer with your own words, in which you abuſe the authority of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> pag. 347. in fine, <hi>When the Scripture preſents us with ſome paſſage, whereof the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſence is contrary to what the ſenſes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon judge of it with certainty, we muſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to weaken the teſtimony of theſe</hi> (that is of our ſenſes and reaſon) <hi>to ſubmit them to that apparent ſence of Scripture: but we muſt interpret Scripture, and finde out ſome other ſence thereof.</hi> And if you urge the Authority of the Church, they will all finde ſome matter of Fact to elude the Popes Bulls, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Councells, and it will be impoſſible to finde any Decree of Councell, or Pope, which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="472" facs="tcp:96350:264"/>
                     <hi>of Janſenius his Book, and condemned in the ſenſe intended by Janſenius; and we do again condemn them as ſuch; and we condemn the Book of Janſenius.</hi> The Janſeniſts, or thoſe of <hi>Port-Royall,</hi> ſay, the Five Propoſitions are not in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> nor condemned in <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Senſe; that the Book of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and coutaineth not Hereſie. What can be more oppoſite to the Popes Definition?</p>
                  <p>Now what you reply, That this is not matter of Faith, to know whether the Propoſitions be <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s, or no, I have already anſwered you in the Second and Third Objection.

The ſequell will ſhew the Truth of what I ſay, and declare the aim of theſe turbulent ſpirits.

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:96350:264"/>
thought ſimple fools: But they ſay ſo, That the world upon their credit may judge that the Five Propoſitions are not there; or (which is equivalent) that the Doctrine which is there, is good Doctrine, and not condemnend. And ſo by ſaying this, they do really approve the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Authority of the Book, and condemn the Church for falſely cenſuring a good Book. Nor is this to gueſſe at their intentions, as the Authour of the Provinciall Letters ſaith (Let. 17. pag. 301.) For it is evident, that no man would tell us, as he doth, <hi>That above Sixty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, all Doctours, have read the Book, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde the Five Propoſitions there,</hi> for any other reaſon then to make the world think that they are not there, and that there is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in his Book.</p>
                  <p>Now as he could not be eſteemed a Chriſtian as to his belief, who having the repute of a Doctour ſhould ſay, I have read over all the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, and finde nothing in it againſt reaſon, and which may not well be believed: ſo he cannot be eſteemed a Catholique, who after the Authority of the Popes Bull, the Synod of <hi>France,</hi> and the whole Church, ſhould ſay, I have read over all <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Book, and finde no Hereticall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions there. Certainly it were no raſh judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to thinke that man no Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, who ſhould ſay, I have read all <hi>Luthers</hi> Works, and all <hi>Calvins</hi> too and finde not any thing there, which is not Orthodox; ſince the Romane Church hath condemned thoſe Books. And ſo alſo it cannot be deemed a raſh judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to think him no Catholique, who ſaith as
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:96350:265"/>
much of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> For the Doctrine of the five Propoſitions is as plainly laid down in <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> as anything contrary to the Catholique Faith is in <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or any Heretique.</p>
                  <p>And this, Sir, as it confuteth your reaſon, ſo I hope 'twill take away the wonder, you expreſs ſo largely in the beginning of your Letter, at ſeeing thoſe of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> called Heretiques; who, as you ſay, admit the Propoſitions condemned in the Bull. For if they allow the Bull, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the five Propoſitions condemned in the Bull, they alſo maintain <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and defend the five Propoſitions in his Book; which they will have to be all good and Catholique. And in ſo doing they ſhew themſelves to be manifeſt Heretiques, by really maintaining that which they verbally deny; or if you will have it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms, by granting the five Propoſitions to be Heretical in the Bull, and defending them to be Catholique in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> though they be the ſame in both places, as is evident to all that can read, by confronting the places: and to all that cannot read, by the publique Authority of the Church. Whereas on the contrary no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth the Propoſitions to be in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> that deſerveth any credit. For that the Author of the Provincial Letters telleth us, there are above ſixty Doctours, who have read <hi>Janſenius</hi> and finde them not there, ſignifieth nothing: that Authour being a man that dareth not ſhew his face; a man convinced of notorious Impoſtures and falſifications; a man that advanceth ſo many things againſt reaſon, that he ſeemeth to have loſt his wits, or drowned them in paſſion. And
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:96350:265"/>
yet this very man, who brings this to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Hereſie, dareth not name one of thoſe Sixty Perſons; which maketh all men juſtly ſuſpect, either that there are no ſuch perſons to be found, or elſe that they are not reſponſible men, ſince they dare not own, what he aſſureth, that they ſay. So that me-thinks this Argument of Sixty Perſons which he bringeth, is juſt as if a man convinced before a Judge, by a number of ſufficient legal Witneſſes, of ſtealing a Horſe, ſhould anſwer for himſelf, that above ſixty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whereof he will produce never a one, could ſwear, that they never knew him to be a Thief, though they have known him all his life time: which would never ſave that man from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, Sir, all the Arguments, by which you in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Letter, and your Friend in the Little Letter, which lyeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, endeavour to prove, that the Janſeniſts ought not to be called Heretiques, are fully confuted: and it is made clear, that never a reaſon you alledge, excuſeth the Janſeniſts, not onely from Schiſme, (which your friend <hi>pag.</hi> 321. alloweth that they deſerve) but from the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Heretique: ſince they maintain in <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> thoſe Propoſitions, which the Pope and the unverſall Church tell us, are Hereticall in <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as I promiſed, I will ſay a word or two to your Stories; whereby you would prove, that Popes and Councels may erre in matter of Fact. The firſt thing then that I ſay to all your Stories and paſſages of Fathers and Divines, by which
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:96350:266"/>
you would prove, that Popes and Councels may erre, is, that they need no Anſwers at all. This is evident, becauſe they are all brought to prove that which is not in queſtion betwixt you and your Adverſaries. It is granted to you, that a Catholique may hold, that a Pope or Councel may erre in matter of Fact; for example, that a Pope may upon a falſe Information eſteem a man unjuſt, Simoniacall, or Hereticall, who is not ſo. It was therefore to no purpoſe for you to prove this with many Stories and Allegations; for it made nothing to your buſineſſe. But, Sir, that which you were to have proved was, that they (the Popes and Synod) have erred in this matter of condemning <hi>Janſenius.</hi> But this is ſo impoſſible to do, that you never go about it, ſave onely by ſaying, that the Jeſuits procured the Bull: which how fond a toy it is, I ſhewed in the beginning of this Letter, where I anſwered what you ſay againſt the Jeſuits. This is the firſt thing I had to ſay concerning your Stories.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is, that your alledging theſe ſtories, as you do, maketh me much ſuſpect that which you would ſo ſain hide; that is, that you are an Heretique. What dutifull ſubject would rip up the faults, or diſgraces, of his Sovereigns predeceſſours, when he were not forced upon it? or what Catholique would make it his buſineſſe, to divulge the errours committed by Biſhops and Popes, when it made nothing to the aim of his diſcourſe? <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is commended for ſaying, that if he ſaw a Prieſt commit Fornication, he would cover him with his own robes, to hide that crime from all the world. But you tell us <hi>pag.</hi>
                     <pb n="477" facs="tcp:96350:266"/>
308. <hi>That you think fit to accuſtome us to the contrarieties, which happen in the Church in matter of Fact, and give us inſtances of one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Church againſt another, of a Pope againſt a Pope, and of a Councel againſt a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</hi> What Catholique, I pray, ever thought this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it? or what good can this produce? what could the ſequel be, (were you a man of any credit in your ſtori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When I read your firſt Letters, I imagined you had ſome ſpleen againſt the Jeſuits; but now I ſee your malice is againſt the Church. You load the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits with calumnies, that it may be thought, that men of ſuch wicked practices, as you deſcribe them, might eaſily be believed to have wronged <hi>Janſeniu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> by falſe accuſations. And you ſet out many Hiſtories of the Errours of Popes and Councels, that it might as eaſily be believed, that the Pope and Synod of <hi>France</hi> have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>d, in condemning <hi>Janſenius</hi> upon the Jeſuits falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And ſo you leave nothing certain in the Church, nothing to be obeyed; for what is certain? what is to be ſubmitted unto, if not the Decrees of Popes and Councels? But I deſire the Reader to take notice, that as you have done in the Jeſuits Books, ſo in the Hiſtories of the Popes and Councels which you mention, you have falſified and miſapplied many things, and given for certain, that which the beſt Authors have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered as very dubious and ſuſpected; as may be
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:96350:267"/>
ſeen in <hi>Baronius, Bellarmin,</hi> and others; where is ſet down a clear anſwer to every one of theſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But you did not think ſit to ſet down the Anſwers; it was enough for you to bring the Objections, ſo to undermine, as much as you could, the Authority of the Church, by making the world think, Fathers were againſt Fathers, Popes, againſt Popes, Councells againſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells: which never was in any matter, which brings any conſequence to deſtroy the union of Faith, and ſubmiſſion to the Church, which is that you would overthrow. It would be too long a buſineſſe to refute every particular ſtory. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf then to tell the Reader, That 'tis you that tell theſe ſtories, that is, one, who for his perpetuall Impoſture deſerves no credit all. And that <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and many Learned Controvertiſts beſide, have ſolved all the difficulties which occurre in theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; all which have been objected by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Adverſaries of the Catholique Church with more vigour, then this Pedant objects them with.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing then which you ſay, and with which I conclude, is, That you tell us in the end of your Eighteenth Letter, That Jeſuits wrong the memory of a Biſhop, that died in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholique Church, and make a great noiſe about a matter of no concern. Your Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

hath made ſome run into ſtrange judgement, and draw ſuch conſequences, that I ſhould be aſhamed to tell, did not the deſire I have to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like, oblige me to it. I will tell you then two paſſages, which I have from perſons that I eſteem credible.</p>
            <p>There was not very long ſince one, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the multiplicity of Religions, that ſwarm daily in <hi>England,</hi> was reſolved at length to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Catholique Faith. But unfortunately it happpened, that the perſon, before the day was come of being Reconciled, light on the Book of the Provinciall Letters; and having read it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to become Catholique: and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect quitted all former good thoughts, upon this Enthymeme, If the Doctours of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church teach ſuch horrid Maximes, what good can I there expect for my ſoul?</p>
            <p>Had this poor creature but once asked the Queſtion, <hi>Quis quem accuſat? Who accuſeth whom?</hi> It would have been eaſie to diſcover, that good thoughts were not on ſo ſlight authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be laid aſide; that a number of learned men were not to be condemned on the verdict of an infamous Libeller; that it was eaſie for a ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>underer to belye all the learned men in the world; but that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y were not therefore to be eſteemed the worſe; otherwiſe we muſt never embrace any Religion; for there is none, which ſome have not made invectives againſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diſgrace: and we muſt renounce all Communities; there being none ſo holy, which the envy of ſome or other hath not railed at, and defamed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="485" facs="tcp:96350:270"/>
This is the firſt paſſage. The ſecond was of a ſadder conſequence then this. One there is in the World, who beareth the name of a Divine, who aſſevered that one might take the Oath of Abjuration, though (as he allowed it to be) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Conſcience; and in eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct made ſome take it. His reaſon was this, The Authour of the Provincial Letters, ſaith he, telleth us, Let. 5. that <hi>the Jeſuits in China permit the Chriſtians to commit Idolatry by a ſubtil invention,</hi> viz. <hi>that of enjoyning them to hide under their clothes an Image of Jeſus Chriſt, to which they teach them by a mentall reſervation to direct thoſe publique Adorations, which they render to the Idol Cachim-Choam, and their Keum-Fucum:</hi> ſince therefore that the Jeſuits permit Idolatry in <hi>China,</hi> we may permit (ſaith this unworthy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) the Oath of Abjuration here in <hi>England.</hi> Did ever man hear ſuch a ſenſleſſe diſcourſe? If the Jeſuits do permit Idolatry in <hi>China,</hi> they ought to be puniſhed moſt ſeverely; but no man ought to inferre, that becauſe the Jeſuits commit (as this ſtory would have it) a moſt hainous crime in <hi>China,</hi> therefore we may commit as hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſins here. But he that ſeduced thoſe Venal Souls, who were ſo baſe minded, that they would ſell their Faith, their R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="486" facs="tcp:96350:271"/>
this man, I ſay, accuſeth the Jeſuits; and thoſe Jeſuits, who contemning all the contents which friends and countrey can afford them, for to preach the Goſpel in the utmoſt bounds of the earth, undertake an Apoſtolicall life, and are (as Authentique ſtories from thence relate) ſeconded by the aſſiſtance of God, who bleſſeth their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with plentifull Converſions of whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſeeing the Signs and Prodigies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God confirmeth their words, willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſweet Yoke of Chriſt, and lead a life of admirable ſanctity. Is it credible, that ſuch men ſhould embrace ſo many labours by Sea and Land, and endure ſuch hardſhip in unknowne Countries, for to crown their works with teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or allowing Idolatry? Certainly it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> anſwer, that it is he that citeth them; and that's enough to let you know, the Citations have no credit at all.</p>
            <p>But to return to the conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quence, which this
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:96350:271"/>
wicked Divine, and that other unfortunate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon made, I muſt needs by this occaſion warn all, that no conſequences can be drawn out of the Maximes, which in theſe Provinciall Letters are attributed to the Jeſuits. For if to build on Sand be ill, to build on a Lye is far worſe. And although in this Anſwer all is not refuted, yet I aſſure the Reader, that there is nothing in all the Provinciall Letters, which has any more credit then what is refuted: all is but a fabulous Dream, all a falſe Slaunder, and the whole Book of the Provinciall Letters nothing elſe but a Pacquet of lies. It would require a very long work to run through all the Objections made in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Letters, and would prove tedious to the Reader, to load him with a long volume, whilſt he may juſtly be ſatisfied with what is here preſented. Yet if hereafter I finde it neceſſary to anſwer every particular, I will do it, and undertake to make good all the <hi>Morall</hi> of the Society calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated in the Provinciall Letters, according to thoſe four conditions which I put in the Preface to the Impoſtures.</p>
            <p>Now therefore there remains nothing elſe, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to anſwer the Additionalls of the Second Engliſh Edition. But looking on them, I finde them to be of ſuch a nature, that they need no anſwer. I ſhall therefore ſhew you, why they need no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and do no more.</p>
            <p>The fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt thing added in the Second Edition is called <hi>the Jeſuites Creed;</hi> ſo childiſh a Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that though it ſeemeth there was a man in the world ſo fooliſh as to print it in Engliſh, yet I preſume there is no body in <hi>England</hi> ſo fooliſh,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:96350:272"/>
as to believe that ever any man taught it; nor any man of ſo weak a judgement, that will think it needs an anſwer. All I will ſay is, that it is a very fit Frontiſpice for ſo fabulous a Work, as the Provinciall Letters.</p>
            <p>The next thing is the Picture of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> amidſt four other Jeſuits at the beginning of the Letters, with ignominious Inſcriptions; and at the end a headleſſe diſcourſe of St <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the Society founded by him; all which (inaſmuch as it is aginſt St. <hi>Ignatius)</hi> being Blaſphemous, (for it is Blaſphemy to ſpeak diſreſpectfully either of God or his Saints) I ſuppſe no Catholique will expect an anſwer to it: And no Proteſtant will judge that it was fit for a Catholique (who profeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth a Reverence to Saints) to deride the Saints. But the Authour of the Provinciall Letters having writ contumeliouſly of the Church Militant, there remained nothing to be added, but to mock at the Saints in Heaven, and to ſport with the Church Triumphant. Yet neither are excuſed; both may juſtly fear that which <hi>Tobias,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> a figure of the Church, ſaith, chap. 13 ver. 16. <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicti erunt, qui cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>After thoſe Blaſphemies there follow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Pieces, made (or ſaid to be made) by the <hi>Curez</hi> in divers places of <hi>France,</hi> to which I will come preſently, when I have ſaid a word to the other Trifles packed up in the Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onalls.</p>
            <p>In the page 70. to page 86. there's a great deal adoe made againſt <hi>Caramu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Holy Order of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> it belongeth not to the Jeſuites to anſwer for his Doctrine: nor would any but a Myſterious Fool have packt his Doctrine into the Myſtery of Jeſuitiſme. But I underſtand, he that printed this Book wanted not onely Grace, (which 'tis evident he did) but (which he was much more ſenſible of) money; and hoped to gain by the bulk of his Book, and ſo thruſt in every thing to make ſo many more Sheets. And I ſuppoſe he is reſolved, ſo long as this way will yield him money, to trade in Myſteries. We have ſeen a ſecond part of <hi>the Myſtery of Jeſuitiſme;</hi> and we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a third, and a fourth, ſo long as there is hope of gain, the true Source of theſe Works, and the Myſtery of all theſe Myſteries.</p>
            <p>But to return, if any man have juſt reaſon to reply againſt <hi>Caramuells</hi> Doctrine, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that he is ſtill living, and now an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and will eaſily be able to anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; provided, that the Objections made againſt his Doctrine be put in Latin; for he will not ſtudy in Engliſh to anſwer a Libell: But if he ſhould chance to die, his Order will out-live all theſe Calumniatours, and be able to defend it ſelf, when the Adverſary is ſuch, that he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth an anſwer, which this man doth not.</p>

All this is in the very firſt Paragraph; which when I read, I could not but wonder, to ſee how blinde Paſſion had made the Authour of the Additionals, who could not ſee, that by producing this Letter, he made a Defence of the Jeſuits, whoſe reputation he would wound. <hi>Sagittae parvu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if he had ſuch animoſity againſt the Jeſuits Doctrine, his ſucceſſour, who now is Archbiſhop of <hi>Machelin</hi> and a worthy Prelate, hath teſtified his opinion to the contrary, by his approbation given to the Anſwers of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Letters, which are tranſlated in this Book, as may be ſeen in the end of a Book intituled, <hi>Reſponces aux Lettres Provinciales publices par le Secretaire du Port-Royall,</hi> printed at <hi>Liege,</hi> 1657.</p>
            <p>The laſt piece of theſe Additionalls is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of all the names of the Caſuiſts cited in the Provinciall Letters and Additionals. A man would think, that in a catalogue of Names there ſhould not be any thing to be reprehended: yet that this piece might be ſuitable to the reſt of the Book, the Authour hath found a way to declar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> either his groſſe ignorance, or malice, in putting diverſe Authors as Jeſuits, whom all the world know, not to be ſuch. For example <hi>Baſilius Pontius</hi> is writ in great Letters, as one whoſe Caſes this Additioner judgeth ſpecially criminall, and that all may redound on the Jeſuits, he is in this catalogue called a Jeſuit: yet <hi>Baſilius Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> is known to be of Saint <hi>Auguſtins</hi> Order. <hi>Sancius</hi> is alſo called a Jeſuit, who was a Secular Prieſt. <hi>Angelus</hi> is alſo reckoned a Jeſuit, though he were a <hi>Franciſca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:96350:274"/>
are confounded two very eminent men. For there is <hi>Martin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All theſe this ignorant Additioner calleth Jeſuites, that the blame, which he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth they lye under, may fall on the Society. But if they were Jeſuites, they would prove a credit to the Society; their Doctrine being far above the cenſure of ſuch an ignorant Additioner, who hath ſo little examined what is cited, that he doth not ſo much as know the Authors that are cietd.</p>
            <p>The like impudence and ignorance is ſhewed in the Index, put in the beginning of the Firſt Engliſh Edition: where the Tranſlatour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to faſten upon the Jeſuites the names of horrid crimes, maketh rather an Index of his own blindeneſſe, malice, and paſſion, then of the Book. For example under the letter <hi>K.</hi> he hath this, <hi>A man may be killed for ſix or ſeven Duckats, or a Crown;</hi> and a little after, <hi>A man may be killed for an Apple.</hi> By which he would give the Reader to underſtand, That the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites are ſtrangely prodigall of mens lives, and their Doctrine guilty of unheard of cruelti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s. But if we look on the places cited, we ſhall ſee the caſe is quite altered; and that the Authour of this Index hath made it his buſineſſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the <hi>Fourbe,</hi> and out-lye the Provinciall Letters, for to make the Jeſuites more odious, The firſt of theſe Maximes, for which <hi>Molina</hi> is cited <hi>pag.</hi> 151. is in that <hi>pag.</hi> ſo ſet down, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The other Maxime is, <hi>That a man may be killed for an Apple.</hi> By this the Index-maker would have it thought, That the Ieſuites value mens lives ſo little, that for an Apple one man may kill another: which if it were true, you might kill a man, that would ſteal an apple out of your O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For in ſuch a caſe a man may recover it, nay if need be, kill the perſon that hath it; becauſe this is not ſo much to defend ones goods, as ones ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> In which place <hi>Leſſius</hi> doth not teach, That you may kill for an apple; but that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Honour is not bound to ſtand ſtill, and receive an affront, though the thing, in which he is affronted, be of no value. For example, a Gentleman carrieth a Roſe in his hand, or an apple; an inſolent Fellow, who would affront that Gentleman, ſnatcheth at the Roſe; the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is not bound to let the Roſe go, but he may ſafely hold it faſt; and if the other proceed in his inſolency, the Gentleman may endeavour to repell him: and if in the end of the ſtrife the inſolent fellow loſe his life, the Gentleman ſhall not be guilty, ſaith <hi>Leſſius,</hi> of his blood, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he keep (that which all Divines exact in ſuch caſes) <hi>moderamen inculpatae tutelae, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a blamleſs defence,</hi> that is, do no more then is neceſſary for his own defence, as <hi>Leſſius</hi> requireth. Now this Doctrine, which gives the Honourable and Innocent Perſon a juſt right to defend himſelf, is very far from teaching, <hi>That one may kill another for an Apple,</hi> which <hi>Leſſius</hi> never dreamt of. The Authour of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Letters would impoſe it on him; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth it not plain enough, the Index helps him out in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet becauſe theſe <hi>Factums</hi> of the Curez are ſpread here in <hi>England,</hi> for no other reaſon then
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:96350:277"/>
to diſcredit the Doctrine of the Society, I think it but reaſon to ſet down ſome Thoughts, which may induce the Reader to ſuſpend his judgement, till the matter be decided at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is, That it is not certain, that theſe <hi>Factums,</hi> or Repreſentations of the Curez are really and truly legall acts; becauſe that ſome of the ableſt Curez are ſaid to have renounced them, and ſome to have profeſſed, that their names were ſet by others to theſe <hi>Factums,</hi> when they k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ew nothing of it. This, if when it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Teſt, it proveth ſo, will ſhew, that the whole buſineſſe is but a turbulent proceeding of ſome unquiet ſpirits, and not really the Deed of the Curez in generall, as is pretended. I k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow the laſt Piece in the Additionalls main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, that the <hi>Factum</hi> is truly the Deed of the Curez. But I ſay, That ſtill it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that either that, or the former, was really a Deed of all, as is pretended, and not rather the act of a factious party, that uſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ped the name of all. And altho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh I will not interpoſe to decide the queſtion, yet I ſay we in <hi>England</hi> cannot at all be ſure, having no other ground, but the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioner, or Printers aſſurance, which no man can juſtly eſteem any thing at all; he being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in the former anſwers to the Additionalls to be maliciouſly bent to ſay any thing, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eemeth againſt the Jeſuites, be it true or falſe, not ſparing even Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>The Second Thought is, That ſuppoſing it be allowed, that theſe <hi>Factums</hi> are legall, then all that followeth is contained in theſe two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. Firſt, That thoſe Curez think, that
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:96350:277"/>
theſe opinions are taught by the Authours whom they alledge. Secondly, That the opinions in the judgements of theſe Curez are not tenible, and ought not to be taught. Now as to the firſt conſequence, that they are miſtaken in divers of the opinions is moſt certain. For example in the very firſt of the Catalogue, pag. 17. there is a notable errour. viz. They ſay, <hi>That the Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts teach, that a man may be confident he doth not ſin, though he quit an opinion which he knoweth to be true, and is more ſafe, to follow that which is contrary thereto.</hi> This is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. For no Caſuiſt doth teach, That you may quit an opinion, <hi>which you know to be true:</hi> that were a meer madneſſe; no Probability can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you againſt <hi>a known Truth.</hi> But the whole Doctrine of Probability, according to all Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, ſuppoſeth <hi>a doubt</hi> on each ſide. See the four firſt Impoſtures, and you will be ſatisfied of this.</p>
            <p>Now as to the ſecond Conſequence, which I ſaid followed, if it be allowed that theſe <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctums</hi> are valid and legall; to wit, That the the Curez think that theſe opinions (I ſpeak now onely of thoſe which are truly cited) are not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible, and ought not to be taught. I anſwer, That though they think ſo, yet we are not bound to joyn in their opinion, till the Church hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and declared for them. The Curez are on the one ſide, and the chiefeſt Divines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom that have ever writ, are on the contrary. Whom ſhall we believe? The Curez are not known to have taught Divinity, nor writ Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe matters, in which they give their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:96350:278"/>
They bring no reaſons, nor cite no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. For my part I ſhall rather believe one learned Authour, who hath joyned long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with ſolid ſtudy, then forty unlearned men, either <hi>Curez,</hi> or Jeſuits, or others. Which I do not ſay to villifie the <hi>Curez,</hi> but to reflect on the Authority which they oppoſe. For example, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the caſes, which are by the <hi>Curez</hi> ſuppoſed dangerous Propoſitions, are <hi>Navarre</hi>'s opinions, though they do not cite <hi>Navarre,</hi> but ſome Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. And I tell them, I will ſooner believe <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> alone, then a hundred ſuch as never taught Divinity, never ſtudied Canon-Law, (the chief ground of Morall Divinity) nor never had any Auctority or name in the Church: whereas <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> hath the approbation of all learned men in the world, is read in all Univerſities, and in the whole Church of God eſteemed an Oracle of Learning. What then ſhall we ſay, when the <hi>Curez</hi> do not onely oppoſe <hi>Navarre</hi> alone, but St. <hi>Antonine,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas, Gerſon, Sylveſter, Raymundus, Cajetan, Soto, Medina, Lopez, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Navarre, Angelus, Corduba, Sanchez, Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez, Molina, Vaſquez, Leſſius, Layman,</hi> and an hundred others? But of this again I advertiſe the Reader, that I pretend not to diminiſh the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctority of any Learned man, <hi>Curé</hi> or other: onely I ſay, it is not ſetting a number of hands to a Bill, which ought to ſway, but Reaſon, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Learning, that muſt be heard.</p>
            <p>The third Thought concerneth the Apologiſt, that writ the Book, which moſt of theſe <hi>Curez</hi> are ſo violently ſet againſt, and which maketh ſo much noiſe in <hi>France.</hi> The man, whoſoever he
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:96350:278"/>
be (for he is unknown to me) is a very learned man; and I believe they that cenſure him, will never be able to diſprove him. And therefore I could wiſh, they would leave the cenſure to him, to whom it belongeth, that is, to the Pope, and that Judicature which the Pope hath erected for that purpoſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither the Apologiſt hath appealed. He cannot be condemned, but that very many of the main Doctours of all Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Religious Communities muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with him. For he is ſo wary, that he advanceth nothing without great Authority, and rather delivereth the opinions of others then his own. I will not ſay, but that there may be ſome fault in him. I know divers have condemned him, and divers alſo maintain him: and unleſſe a greater authority intervene, then what one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Academy, or any ſingle perſons verdict can give, he hath and will alwayes have the greateſt part of Univerſities and Divines for him. The opinions, which he delivereth <hi>as probable</hi> are ſo, and will be ſo, till he that hath authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, and teach the univerſall Church in matters of Faith and Manners, ſhall be pleaſed to teach us the contrary. When that is done, I ſuppoſe the Authour of the Apology will ſubmit, and all good Catholiques with him. Till then, if I think the Apology is a learned Book, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſolid Doctrine, I think ſo with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nes</hi> in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> whoſe Faith, Doctrine, and Life are ſuch, that no man can call them in queſtion; and this every perſon may think, till Higher Powers diſpoſe otherwiſe. This maketh it clear, that
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:96350:279"/>
all theſe <hi>Factums,</hi> or Writings, of theſe Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onalls, ought not to prejudice the Apologiſt; much leſſe can they (as they are here intended in <hi>England)</hi> any wayes Patronize the Provinciall Letters, which are argued of manifeſt Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re, in ſo many, and ſo notorious falſific <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions. Yet he that hath turned the Provinciall Letters into Latine, and calleth himſelf <hi>Willelmus Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drockius,</hi> ſuppoſeth that all theſe <hi>Curez</hi> are for him, and that they joyn iſſue with the Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Thought is, That I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we may juſtly, with due reſpect, ask ſome Queſtions of the Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ez, which will breed occaſion of wonder. Firſt then I ask, why the Curez are ſo much againſt the Apology of the Caſuiſts? That Book was made to vindicate the credit of all Caſuiſts againſt the ſcof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing Irriſions of a Pamphleter. So that it ſeemeth, That to oppoſe the Apology may be conſtrued to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſire of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending a Buffoon againſt a Religious Order, and againſt all Caſuiſts; which I will not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſuch Perſons. Secondly I ask, why the Curez taking their Caſes, which they would have condemned, out of a Book which containeth Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſme, never take notice of the greater errors, I mean the Hereſies, contained in that Book. I know they endeavour an anſwer; yet it is ſuch as doth not ſatifie. For ſtill the wonder remaineth, why the <hi>Curez</hi> ſhould not ſhew as much zeal, in deſiring that Hereticall Opinions, which daily ſpread in <hi>France,</hi> ſhould be ſuppreſſed, as they do, that the Morall Doctrine, which they eſteem bad, ſhould be condemned. Thirdly I ask, why
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:96350:279"/>
do not theſe Curez point us out ſome body, whom we may ſafely follow in reſolving of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? By taking the authority from all Caſuiſts, they leave us in the dark, and wholly guideleſſe in the many doubts which daily ariſe. Is there no body who may ſafely be followed in matter of Caſes? Is there in the Church no means to clear up doubts in Morality? Fourthly, to end theſe Queries, doth not this way of proceeding prejudice the Curez themſelves, and take away all their authority in deciding any doubt, which may ariſe in every one of their reſpective Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes? For if <hi>Bonacina,</hi> if <hi>Sanchez,</hi> if <hi>Navarr,</hi> if <hi>Leſſius,</hi> if <hi>Suarez,</hi> if <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> may not be believed; if their authority muſt not be heard, though Two, or Three, or Ten, (or as <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drockius</hi> ſaith <hi>ten thouſand)</hi> agree in a caſe, upon what account ſhall the <hi>Cure</hi> be believed? Allow the <hi>Cure</hi> as much vertue and learning as you will, yet he cannot expect to be generally eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more vertuous, or more learned then <hi>Navarr.</hi> And ſo, if one man, though never ſo learned, cannot decide a doubt, and appeaſe a fearfull conſcience, then all Curez and all Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may ſit ſtill, and ſhall have no authority in ſettling conſciences, and taking away doubts. And at length Spirituall Directours ſhall in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſcience have leſſe credit, then a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician or Lawyer in their Profeſſion. Nay theſe, if they be able and conſcientious men, ſhall have more credit even in matter of conſcience, then a Ghoſtly Father. For the Phyſician ſhall be believed, if he tell his Patient, that he may eat Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh on a Friday, or that he is not obliged to
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:96350:280"/>
faſt: and the Lawyer ſhall be credited, if he warrant his Client, that he may juſtly keep the Land which the Client doubted of. But the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> ſhall have no authority left him in any doubt, for feare of the Monſter of Probability. For whatſoever he ſaith, his Pariſhioners will tell him that he is but one Divine, and that one Divine (according to his own Doctrine) cannot ſafely be followed.</p>
            <p>All this in my opinion doth evidently inferre, that we cannot upon the <hi>Curez</hi> complaints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Apologiſt, and thoſe Caſuiſts whom he citeth and followeth. Yet my intention is not to diſpute againſt the <hi>Curez,</hi> nor do I undertake to defend the Apologiſt. But as I begun, ſo I conclude, that ſince the Pope hath Evocated the Cauſe of the <hi>Curez</hi> and the Apologiſt to himſelf, it is the duty of every good Catholique to expect thoſe cenſures, and not to precipitate his own. But whatſoever be the event of the Apology, this is ſure, that the Provinciall Letters are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Holineſſe: and that they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of manifeſt Impoſture, Slaunder, Ignorance, and Hereſie; which being ſo, the Doctrine of the Jeſuits, and other School-Divines whom thoſe Letters inveigh againſt, ought not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced on that account; which is all that theſe Anſwers intended to ſhew.</p>

            <p>There are in it Six Pieces; whereof the two firſt are made by one <hi>Peter Jarrige,</hi> during the time of his Apoſtaſie from the Society. That theſe deſerve no anſwer is palpable for three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The firſt is, That they were made by an Apoſtata, who renounced the Catholique Faith, in which he had from his infancy been bred;
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:96350:281"/>
broke his vows to God, forſook his Religious Order upon private diſguſts, and run away firſt to <hi>Rochel,</hi> and then into <hi>Holland.</hi> All which (if there were nothing elſe) maketh it evidently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, That he is not a competent witneſs againſt the Society. A Thief may as well be choſen judge of honeſt dealing, and a Rebell of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as an Apoſtata of Religion.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is, to finde ſome body, that will ſpeak againſt the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites. But as it happened with Chriſt, ſo in this doth it happen to the Jeſuites; <hi>Non erat conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>in relation to their Politiques.</hi> A gallant Title, and I ſhould have been very glad to have read the Work over and over, if I had met with any thing of Truth in it. For I eſteem the Society a very <hi>Politique Body;</hi> which hath a very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>oeconomy.</hi> But in peruſing this Piece, I finde it no better then a dream of a crack'd brain. The two grounds of all this Policy are notorious ſlaunders, and known for ſuch all the world over. The firſt is, That the Jeſuites build their Politiques on calumnies and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dering of others; which is as far from their practice, as it is from true prudence. There is nothing in the world more fooliſh, then to think to raiſe ones ſelf to any ſtanding Dignity by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lauda ut lauderis, Marce; ut ameris ama,</hi> ſaith the Poet. Nothing begets greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred then calumny: and ſo the Jeſuites Politicks and inſinuating themſelves cannot go upon that principle. The other is, their inſinuating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into all States and Court-affairs, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them a great knowledge of all that paſſes in the world, that they can acquaint their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of all things. Pretty. But by what way do they thus in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inuate themſelves into all Princes Favou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ute. The whole Diſcourſe is ſtuffed with ſuch open falſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, that I need not ſay any thing. 'Tis openly falſe, that the Jeſuites ever inform their Generall, as you ſet it down, of State af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, or that they meddle with State affairs, ſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>verely forbid among them. 'Tis openly falſe,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:96350:284"/>
and an intollerable ſlaunder to ſay, they make uſe of <hi>the Secret of</hi> Confeſſion for this inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Generall, as you aſſever page the ſixth. 'Tis openly falſe to ſay, That they refuſe to hear the Confeſſions of poor people, as you aſſever in the ſame page. 'Tis openly falſe (to come home to <hi>England)</hi> to ſay, That the Archprieſt is a Jeſuite <hi>in voto,</hi> as you ſay page 21. All that you ſay of Jeſuites <hi>in voto</hi> is a meer fable: and all that Diſcourſe of yours concerning Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> page 20. is a fiction and a meer dream. And ſo I will leave it to ſleep with its Authour in his grave.</p>
            <p>The laſt Piece of the Myſtery is a Propheſie with a Comment upon it. The Propheſie is taken out of the Four Centuriatours of <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge;</hi> out of whom, many a Fable may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<hi>:</hi> for they are full of them. The Saint, who is ſaid to be the Auhour of it, is St. <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,</hi> who lived (ſaith the <hi>Short view</hi> of the life of St. <hi>Hildegard,</hi> ſet before the Work I now ſpeak of) <hi>in a Monaſtery, built by ſome Magicall Aſſiſtance,</hi> and <hi>there was a ſtrange Conflux of the ſuperſtitious Multitude to her.</hi> Thus doth this Commentatour ſet forth his Propheſie, with ſuch circumſtances that muſt make every rational man ſuppoſe it a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fable. But if the Text be not good, I muſt tell you, the Diſcourſe upon it is worſe. Never was there ſuch a Rhapſody of Non-ſenſe, as this hollow-brain has made for to crown the Myſtery of Jeſuitiſme.</p>
            <p>Firſt he is ſure, the Propheſie was meant of the Jeſuites, becauſe he hath applied it all to them. <hi>Ipſe dixit.</hi> He might as well, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:96350:284"/>
(if this ſell off currantly) will apply all the Apocalypſe, and the twelve leſſer Prophets, to the Jeſuites: for I defie him to make more Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe of any thing, then he hath done of this. For to exempliſie in one onely paſſage, in his firſt Paraphraſe, one of the reaſons, why the Society (as he will have it) is call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Did ever man talk ſo <hi>inſenſatè</hi> (ſo ſenſleſly?) And what will this man judge of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Stylites,</hi> of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who faſted fourty dayes together? But I will not go on with arguing againſt a man, that hath had no care, neither of Truth nor Reaſon, nor appearance of either, in any one page of his Work. So that if he would have taken pains to diſcredit himſelf, and credit the Fathers of the Society, he could not have done it better, then by this <hi>inſenſate</hi> manner of impugning it. But ſo it is, the Integrity of thoſe Fathers, their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and their Piety is ſuch, That as that gallant Prelate of <hi>France</hi> and O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
